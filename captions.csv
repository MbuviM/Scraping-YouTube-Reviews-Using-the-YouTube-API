O36lgfQ7mDk,0.06,3.989,all right The Witcher yes I've seen the
O36lgfQ7mDk,1.77,4.109,requests and stuff takes time right so
O36lgfQ7mDk,4.049,4.111,the Witcher is a series on Netflix that
O36lgfQ7mDk,5.879,4.201,is based off of The Witcher books which
O36lgfQ7mDk,8.16,3.96,the games are also based off of but as I
O36lgfQ7mDk,10.08,4.469,understand this series is based off of
O36lgfQ7mDk,12.12,4.47,the books not necessarily the game and
O36lgfQ7mDk,14.549,4.471,it's this medieval world with magic and
O36lgfQ7mDk,16.59,3.689,warring kingdoms basically hitting at
O36lgfQ7mDk,19.02,3.179,the time they're like I have people
O36lgfQ7mDk,20.279,3.541,totally need they need that Game of
O36lgfQ7mDk,22.199,2.941,Thrones fix and there's no game of
O36lgfQ7mDk,23.82,2.76,Thrones the fact they've needed a game
O36lgfQ7mDk,25.14,2.729,of Thrones fix since before Game of
O36lgfQ7mDk,26.58,2.73,Thrones actually hit and did it for
O36lgfQ7mDk,27.869,2.91,being honest so it's a good time for The
O36lgfQ7mDk,29.31,3.33,Witcher and the meat and bones like the
O36lgfQ7mDk,30.779,3.541,heart of the series for me it's the
O36lgfQ7mDk,32.64,4.2,character Jarrell's he's a Witcher which
O36lgfQ7mDk,34.32,5.04,I don't know much about witchers as I
O36lgfQ7mDk,36.84,4.77,understand their kind of magical mutant
O36lgfQ7mDk,39.36,4.109,people that people actually don't really
O36lgfQ7mDk,41.61,3.51,like and there's not a lot of them
O36lgfQ7mDk,43.469,4.41,anymore I say from what I understand
O36lgfQ7mDk,45.12,6.419,because all right hold on I don't know I
O36lgfQ7mDk,47.879,6.351,don't know if leather blocks pitchforks
O36lgfQ7mDk,51.539,4.921,I got a got to protect myself okay I
O36lgfQ7mDk,54.23,3.669,can't believe I'm gonna say this I think
O36lgfQ7mDk,56.46,2.55,I've said it in other videos but this is
O36lgfQ7mDk,57.899,2.791,what your BAE
O36lgfQ7mDk,59.01,3.24,I haven't played The Witcher games put
O36lgfQ7mDk,60.69,3.06,the keyboard down typing hateful
O36lgfQ7mDk,62.25,3.72,comments I'll make you go blind so I
O36lgfQ7mDk,63.75,3.479,heard okay those lives oh yeah so I
O36lgfQ7mDk,65.97,3.27,haven't played The Witcher game so as
O36lgfQ7mDk,67.229,4.471,I'm watching The Witcher series I'm just
O36lgfQ7mDk,69.24,4.559,coming at it as a person who hey I like
O36lgfQ7mDk,71.7,3.57,a good series so let's watch The Witcher
O36lgfQ7mDk,73.799,3.21,don't know much about the lore I know of
O36lgfQ7mDk,75.27,3.15,Geralt and I know of yennefer because we
O36lgfQ7mDk,77.009,2.761,all know a few nifer so the main
O36lgfQ7mDk,78.42,3.18,character Geralt he has a really
O36lgfQ7mDk,79.77,2.97,interesting story but you don't see a
O36lgfQ7mDk,81.6,3.0,lot of his story it's just what you've
O36lgfQ7mDk,82.74,3.66,heard about I hope to see more of his
O36lgfQ7mDk,84.6,3.42,backstory as a series goes on before
O36lgfQ7mDk,86.4,3.539,right now is just a lot of intrigue with
O36lgfQ7mDk,88.02,4.139,him but man henry cavill bring some
O36lgfQ7mDk,89.939,4.11,charisma to that character at first I
O36lgfQ7mDk,92.159,4.831,was like it's that's a voice you're
O36lgfQ7mDk,94.049,4.32,doing he talks like this all the time I
O36lgfQ7mDk,96.99,3.18,don't know if it's because I know Henry
O36lgfQ7mDk,98.369,3.091,Cavill voice but at first I couldn't get
O36lgfQ7mDk,100.17,2.97,it out of my head that's like he's just
O36lgfQ7mDk,101.46,3.42,doing a voice right at any character who
O36lgfQ7mDk,103.14,3.33,sounds different than the actor they're
O36lgfQ7mDk,104.88,3.0,doing a voice but sometimes it just it
O36lgfQ7mDk,106.47,2.939,doesn't sound weird at first you just
O36lgfQ7mDk,107.88,3.449,kind of roll with it from the get-go
O36lgfQ7mDk,109.409,3.511,this one took me a couple episodes wait
O36lgfQ7mDk,111.329,3.051,a minute I'm he delivered one of these
O36lgfQ7mDk,112.92,4.019,moments mm-hmm
O36lgfQ7mDk,114.38,4.33,[ __ ] that was probably before that but
O36lgfQ7mDk,116.939,2.701,that's definitely that's a marker those
O36lgfQ7mDk,118.71,3.24,momma's your point you're like look
O36lgfQ7mDk,119.64,4.56,that's why he's epic it's actually this
O36lgfQ7mDk,121.95,4.41,series if I'm being honest took me an
O36lgfQ7mDk,124.2,3.51,episode or two to actually get into the
O36lgfQ7mDk,126.36,3.209,first episode I was like alright well
O36lgfQ7mDk,127.71,3.329,that episode happened but I heard the
O36lgfQ7mDk,129.569,3.841,show's good so I'll keep watching but at
O36lgfQ7mDk,131.039,2.881,a point just a charm of the whole series
O36lgfQ7mDk,133.41,1.98,in the end
O36lgfQ7mDk,133.92,2.94,trigger the characters it hooked me and
O36lgfQ7mDk,135.39,4.23,that's what does hook in fact the
O36lgfQ7mDk,136.86,4.86,character I loved most is definitely
O36lgfQ7mDk,139.62,4.08,yennefer no offense Henry you're still a
O36lgfQ7mDk,141.72,3.9,snack we all know that which I guess
O36lgfQ7mDk,143.7,3.24,also he's a big video game nerd and he's
O36lgfQ7mDk,145.62,2.82,a fan of The Witcher and that's why he
O36lgfQ7mDk,146.94,3.87,took the role that's amazing but
O36lgfQ7mDk,148.44,4.799,yennefer yennefer was great and heard
O36lgfQ7mDk,150.81,3.84,her tragedy is really the heart of the
O36lgfQ7mDk,153.239,2.731,show for me I guess there was a bit of
O36lgfQ7mDk,154.65,3.059,controversy surrounding yennefer
O36lgfQ7mDk,155.97,3.63,storyline I guess controversy might be a
O36lgfQ7mDk,157.709,3.331,strong term some people there were some
O36lgfQ7mDk,159.6,3.06,tweets I don't see that perspective
O36lgfQ7mDk,161.04,3.69,because I don't feel like this show was
O36lgfQ7mDk,162.66,4.56,ever saying yes she made the right call
O36lgfQ7mDk,164.73,4.259,she's perfectly happy yep she did it and
O36lgfQ7mDk,167.22,3.45,she's living her perfect life but she's
O36lgfQ7mDk,168.989,3.631,not she's actually quite miserable it's
O36lgfQ7mDk,170.67,3.539,a great cautionary tale about how beauty
O36lgfQ7mDk,172.62,3.149,and powers they're not everything
O36lgfQ7mDk,174.209,3.09,they're not going to bring you happiness
O36lgfQ7mDk,175.769,5.101,the more I think about it the more it's
O36lgfQ7mDk,177.299,5.94,just such a great lesson on looking
O36lgfQ7mDk,180.87,4.5,deeper into the person and the facade
O36lgfQ7mDk,183.239,3.481,people have or maybe not judging people
O36lgfQ7mDk,185.37,3.0,on how they look or the things they have
O36lgfQ7mDk,186.72,3.69,around them like you look at yennefer
O36lgfQ7mDk,188.37,3.69,and you'd be like she's gorgeous she's
O36lgfQ7mDk,190.41,3.299,powerful there's no way she's not the
O36lgfQ7mDk,192.06,3.3,happiest person ever and I feel like
O36lgfQ7mDk,193.709,3.541,that's a very applicable lesson to our
O36lgfQ7mDk,195.36,4.56,world so many times it's easy to see
O36lgfQ7mDk,197.25,4.59,someone whether it be online or an actor
O36lgfQ7mDk,199.92,4.86,or someone on Twitter and influencer an
O36lgfQ7mDk,201.84,4.14,Instagram model a youtuber whoever it's
O36lgfQ7mDk,204.78,3.15,easy to look at them and be like they
O36lgfQ7mDk,205.98,4.02,have the happiest life ever there's no
O36lgfQ7mDk,207.93,4.17,way if I had that life I would be the
O36lgfQ7mDk,210.0,3.84,happiest person alive but you don't
O36lgfQ7mDk,212.1,3.6,really know what you see if a person you
O36lgfQ7mDk,213.84,4.14,see because it's what that person has
O36lgfQ7mDk,215.7,4.53,chosen to show in a lot of cases with
O36lgfQ7mDk,217.98,3.66,most people famous or otherwise people
O36lgfQ7mDk,220.23,2.94,don't generally choose to show their
O36lgfQ7mDk,221.64,3.0,pain in the case of yennefer felt that
O36lgfQ7mDk,223.17,2.49,was really well executed but i felt she
O36lgfQ7mDk,224.64,2.099,made the show to be honest with you
O36lgfQ7mDk,225.66,5.419,she's my favorite and there's the
O36lgfQ7mDk,226.739,7.051,princess whose name is princess ciri
O36lgfQ7mDk,231.079,4.901,like the apple AI look at me honest with
O36lgfQ7mDk,233.79,5.64,you I thought she was good in the show
O36lgfQ7mDk,235.98,5.37,but her storyline always kind of made me
O36lgfQ7mDk,239.43,4.74,feel like I wasn't with the party right
O36lgfQ7mDk,241.35,4.949,now like imagine The Witcher is a party
O36lgfQ7mDk,244.17,3.24,and geralt and yennefer in there man
O36lgfQ7mDk,246.299,2.851,they're in the heart of it they're
O36lgfQ7mDk,247.41,4.59,dancing on the bars the music's going
O36lgfQ7mDk,249.15,5.22,and everyone's having a good time and
O36lgfQ7mDk,252.0,3.42,then you go outside for a break you know
O36lgfQ7mDk,254.37,1.95,maybe a drink of water maybe it's
O36lgfQ7mDk,255.42,2.999,getting too hot in there and you're
O36lgfQ7mDk,256.32,3.75,never away from the energy of the party
O36lgfQ7mDk,258.419,3.391,you're always in its orbit but you're no
O36lgfQ7mDk,260.07,2.82,longer in the heart of it the music's
O36lgfQ7mDk,261.81,3.25,still going but it's a little more
O36lgfQ7mDk,262.89,7.39,muffled alright
O36lgfQ7mDk,265.06,6.329,we'll go back in now the story says what
O36lgfQ7mDk,270.28,3.27,it felt like I felt like every time I
O36lgfQ7mDk,271.389,4.381,was with this character I wasn't with
O36lgfQ7mDk,273.55,3.96,the party of The Witcher she's an
O36lgfQ7mDk,275.77,3.899,important character she needs to find
O36lgfQ7mDk,277.51,3.93,Geralt and that's her arc is her just
O36lgfQ7mDk,279.669,3.361,looking for him still of the three
O36lgfQ7mDk,281.44,3.18,characters my least favorite of the arcs
O36lgfQ7mDk,283.03,3.3,I will say that about the stitching of
O36lgfQ7mDk,284.62,3.45,the show - it took me a little bit at
O36lgfQ7mDk,286.33,4.77,first I was like something seems off it
O36lgfQ7mDk,288.07,4.8,seems very jumpy and not connected then
O36lgfQ7mDk,291.1,3.3,it kind of dawned on me how they were
O36lgfQ7mDk,292.87,3.06,doing it where they were going and I was
O36lgfQ7mDk,294.4,3.0,okay and then it clicked I was fine
O36lgfQ7mDk,295.93,3.12,until then though it felt less than
O36lgfQ7mDk,297.4,3.51,smooth also some of the CGI there are a
O36lgfQ7mDk,299.05,3.03,couple of CGI monster scenes or animal
O36lgfQ7mDk,300.91,3.09,scenes wherever you want to call them
O36lgfQ7mDk,302.08,3.75,mythological creature scenes where
O36lgfQ7mDk,304.0,3.18,you're like that's a CGI monster all
O36lgfQ7mDk,305.83,2.55,right look I don't know if the show cost
O36lgfQ7mDk,307.18,3.18,but I felt like the CGI and the
O36lgfQ7mDk,308.38,4.92,mandalorian was much better than again
O36lgfQ7mDk,310.36,5.7,you have the the biggest most powerful
O36lgfQ7mDk,313.3,4.38,studio behind that show so I get it I
O36lgfQ7mDk,316.06,4.5,will say it could have done passage of
O36lgfQ7mDk,317.68,4.5,time better sometimes a lot of time
O36lgfQ7mDk,320.56,4.14,passes and at one point I was like okay
O36lgfQ7mDk,322.18,3.78,someone needs to say something and to
O36lgfQ7mDk,324.7,2.64,their credit they did there was a
O36lgfQ7mDk,325.96,3.09,throwaway line the person's like I
O36lgfQ7mDk,327.34,3.0,haven't seen you in this many years I
O36lgfQ7mDk,329.05,2.67,was like okay it's been that long but
O36lgfQ7mDk,330.34,2.55,even some other times especially with
O36lgfQ7mDk,331.72,2.58,yennefer she goes and talks to this
O36lgfQ7mDk,332.89,2.37,person who goes and talks to that person
O36lgfQ7mDk,334.3,3.57,I'm like I don't think those two
O36lgfQ7mDk,335.26,4.92,locations are near each other are so did
O36lgfQ7mDk,337.87,4.049,weeks passed months passed days did she
O36lgfQ7mDk,340.18,3.48,[ __ ] teleport I didn't really know a
O36lgfQ7mDk,341.919,3.511,show didn't tell me it's a passage of
O36lgfQ7mDk,343.66,3.18,time it's one of the show's flaws but in
O36lgfQ7mDk,345.43,3.239,the end I had a really great time with
O36lgfQ7mDk,346.84,4.29,The Witcher they did such a good job at
O36lgfQ7mDk,348.669,4.291,portraying likable and charismatic yet
O36lgfQ7mDk,351.13,4.11,flawed characters on screen I mean it's
O36lgfQ7mDk,352.96,4.59,not as though The Witcher Season 1 is
O36lgfQ7mDk,355.24,4.049,some Game of Thrones replacement for
O36lgfQ7mDk,357.55,3.54,Game of Thrones when it was at its peak
O36lgfQ7mDk,359.289,3.841,I mean keep those expectations in check
O36lgfQ7mDk,361.09,3.81,but in its own right it's a really
O36lgfQ7mDk,363.13,3.63,entertaining fantasy epic with really
O36lgfQ7mDk,364.9,4.35,charismatic characters and actors who
O36lgfQ7mDk,366.76,4.29,make themselves make it so like I can't
O36lgfQ7mDk,369.25,3.72,say that without saying it that way the
O36lgfQ7mDk,371.05,3.81,enjoyment I had with the witch are
O36lgfQ7mDk,372.97,2.91,vastly outweighed the flaws I'd like to
O36lgfQ7mDk,374.86,2.76,see where they go with it that's the
O36lgfQ7mDk,375.88,3.39,rule you know leave the audience wanting
O36lgfQ7mDk,377.62,4.169,more and by the end I was like I
O36lgfQ7mDk,379.27,4.05,definitely am salivating for more witch
O36lgfQ7mDk,381.789,2.791,all right so The Witcher on Netflix have
O36lgfQ7mDk,383.32,2.73,you seen it what did you think about it

CcpmD5J8xOk,0.03,4.74,well guys I just finished watching
CcpmD5J8xOk,2.129,3.9,season 1 of The Witcher Netflix show and
CcpmD5J8xOk,4.77,2.79,I thought it'd be good just to share my
CcpmD5J8xOk,6.029,3.001,thoughts and opinion on the show as a
CcpmD5J8xOk,7.56,3.18,whole as I know a lot of people want to
CcpmD5J8xOk,9.03,4.47,hear exactly what I think now I've
CcpmD5J8xOk,10.74,4.769,finished the full series but before I
CcpmD5J8xOk,13.5,3.63,get into a full review I just want to
CcpmD5J8xOk,15.509,3.511,say something for those of you that
CcpmD5J8xOk,17.13,3.75,might not agree with me I might even be
CcpmD5J8xOk,19.02,4.169,angry with me over my opinion I
CcpmD5J8xOk,20.88,4.53,understand what it's like when you
CcpmD5J8xOk,23.189,3.901,really like something and someone else
CcpmD5J8xOk,25.41,3.84,points out the flaws that they see in it
CcpmD5J8xOk,27.09,4.32,sometimes you can feel as if because you
CcpmD5J8xOk,29.25,3.899,like it there simply nitpicking and
CcpmD5J8xOk,31.41,3.57,trying to find anything that they can
CcpmD5J8xOk,33.149,3.331,that's wrong with the thing you like you
CcpmD5J8xOk,34.98,3.419,might feel like they are purposely
CcpmD5J8xOk,36.48,3.75,ignoring any good in it and that by them
CcpmD5J8xOk,38.399,4.021,disliking the show they're trying to
CcpmD5J8xOk,40.23,3.81,influence your opinion influence other
CcpmD5J8xOk,42.42,3.659,people's opinions oh maybe they're
CcpmD5J8xOk,44.04,4.019,trying to attack you for your opinion
CcpmD5J8xOk,46.079,4.441,and tell you your love for that thing is
CcpmD5J8xOk,48.059,5.041,wrong I just want to say that that's not
CcpmD5J8xOk,50.52,5.46,something I have any interest in doing I
CcpmD5J8xOk,53.1,4.979,absolutely hate being the guy that ruins
CcpmD5J8xOk,55.98,3.719,others fun out of spite because I
CcpmD5J8xOk,58.079,3.931,believe people shouldn't like the things
CcpmD5J8xOk,59.699,3.721,I don't like if you love the show I
CcpmD5J8xOk,62.01,3.87,think it represents the winner in a
CcpmD5J8xOk,63.42,4.62,truthful and accurate way or hell even
CcpmD5J8xOk,65.88,4.41,if you just enjoyed watching it I have
CcpmD5J8xOk,68.04,3.93,nothing but respect for you people are
CcpmD5J8xOk,70.29,4.41,gonna say that what I'm doing right now
CcpmD5J8xOk,71.97,4.8,is damage control but honestly guys I
CcpmD5J8xOk,74.7,4.23,just wanted to say this as I really do
CcpmD5J8xOk,76.77,4.11,empathize and I know it sucks when
CcpmD5J8xOk,78.93,3.72,someone dislikes the thing you like and
CcpmD5J8xOk,80.88,3.84,then shares their opinion it just can
CcpmD5J8xOk,82.65,4.44,make you feel a bit bad sometimes so I
CcpmD5J8xOk,84.72,4.079,do empathize completely but anyway and
CcpmD5J8xOk,87.09,3.779,now I've addressed that I just want to
CcpmD5J8xOk,88.799,3.721,say if you love the show or don't want
CcpmD5J8xOk,90.869,3.691,to hear a word against it and know if
CcpmD5J8xOk,92.52,3.9,you do is just gonna upset you or annoy
CcpmD5J8xOk,94.56,3.93,you I'd click off now because I'm gonna
CcpmD5J8xOk,96.42,3.659,be very truthful about my opinion as I
CcpmD5J8xOk,98.49,4.29,feel like that's the best way to just do
CcpmD5J8xOk,100.079,4.711,this review right to begin I'm just
CcpmD5J8xOk,102.78,4.199,gonna be blunt I'm not a fan of the show
CcpmD5J8xOk,104.79,4.71,now before you go crazy I don't think
CcpmD5J8xOk,106.979,4.021,this is actually a bad show I think it
CcpmD5J8xOk,109.5,3.75,has everything in it the mix of a
CcpmD5J8xOk,111.0,4.68,fantasy TV show and I can totally see
CcpmD5J8xOk,113.25,4.649,why so many people seem to like it I
CcpmD5J8xOk,115.68,3.84,think my issues with the show come from
CcpmD5J8xOk,117.899,3.601,me having read the books and not only
CcpmD5J8xOk,119.52,3.51,that but having lived and breathed The
CcpmD5J8xOk,121.5,4.17,Witcher for the past two years of my
CcpmD5J8xOk,123.03,4.439,life I've been a fan for a long time but
CcpmD5J8xOk,125.67,4.199,these past two years this channel has
CcpmD5J8xOk,127.469,3.871,literally been my job and every week
CcpmD5J8xOk,129.869,3.781,I've made a video on the lore of this
CcpmD5J8xOk,131.34,3.69,world requiring me to go back over
CcpmD5J8xOk,133.65,3.539,which are books as well as just general
CcpmD5J8xOk,135.03,3.959,Witcher information I've also played the
CcpmD5J8xOk,137.189,3.66,games every week for the past two years
CcpmD5J8xOk,138.989,3.541,through doing the playthrough and just
CcpmD5J8xOk,140.849,4.411,through having to record gameplay for
CcpmD5J8xOk,142.53,4.739,the videos so yeah I spend a lot of my
CcpmD5J8xOk,145.26,4.5,time thinking about and being involved
CcpmD5J8xOk,147.269,4.47,in this universe what this means is
CcpmD5J8xOk,149.76,4.14,everything they change or do differently
CcpmD5J8xOk,151.739,4.381,in the show is something I'm acutely
CcpmD5J8xOk,153.9,3.899,aware of and find it very difficult to
CcpmD5J8xOk,156.12,4.289,just ignore and they have made some
CcpmD5J8xOk,157.799,4.651,major changes from the books but before
CcpmD5J8xOk,160.409,3.45,I discuss the major changes I'd like to
CcpmD5J8xOk,162.45,2.879,talk about what I thought was well done
CcpmD5J8xOk,163.859,4.171,in the show as I want to give credit
CcpmD5J8xOk,165.329,4.681,where credit is due to begin that I like
CcpmD5J8xOk,168.03,3.69,the scenes with Geraldton dandelion or
CcpmD5J8xOk,170.01,3.809,yeah skier as he's known in the show in
CcpmD5J8xOk,171.72,3.84,the original polish books I think they
CcpmD5J8xOk,173.819,3.75,played off each other pretty well and I
CcpmD5J8xOk,175.56,4.079,think their relationship as it was at
CcpmD5J8xOk,177.569,3.181,that point in the books was presented
CcpmD5J8xOk,179.639,3.27,pretty accurately
CcpmD5J8xOk,180.75,3.689,I mean dandelion on the whole was just
CcpmD5J8xOk,182.909,3.061,pretty entertaining whenever he was on
CcpmD5J8xOk,184.439,2.94,screen that whenever a scene with him
CcpmD5J8xOk,185.97,3.389,came up and it was just gonna be a bit
CcpmD5J8xOk,187.379,3.661,of fun I think Henry Cavill did a pretty
CcpmD5J8xOk,189.359,4.02,good job as Geralt I thought he was
CcpmD5J8xOk,191.04,4.259,alright didn't think he was perfect
CcpmD5J8xOk,193.379,3.961,but I mainly put that down to the facts
CcpmD5J8xOk,195.299,4.44,I have an idea of what Geralt is like
CcpmD5J8xOk,197.34,3.84,how he looks at cetera and by the way my
CcpmD5J8xOk,199.739,3.691,view of Geralt in the books is not
CcpmD5J8xOk,201.18,3.809,identical to the games and just in
CcpmD5J8xOk,203.43,3.6,general it would be very hard for an
CcpmD5J8xOk,204.989,4.231,actor to achieve what I think of as
CcpmD5J8xOk,207.03,4.169,Geralt in my mind I'm always up for
CcpmD5J8xOk,209.22,3.57,fresh interpretations but I feel like it
CcpmD5J8xOk,211.199,3.0,was fairly similar to the Geralt we know
CcpmD5J8xOk,212.79,4.559,but it just didn't quite hit the mark
CcpmD5J8xOk,214.199,6.061,for me however I do think has an actor
CcpmD5J8xOk,217.349,5.73,he played Geralt and when I saw him it
CcpmD5J8xOk,220.26,4.469,didn't feel weird I thought yeah I can
CcpmD5J8xOk,223.079,3.87,see Geralt which I didn't have with all
CcpmD5J8xOk,224.729,4.32,the cast I liked most of the Geralt
CcpmD5J8xOk,226.949,3.93,fight scenes pretty much every fight
CcpmD5J8xOk,229.049,3.69,scene involving Geralt was good so
CcpmD5J8xOk,230.879,3.42,obviously we have their entry fight but
CcpmD5J8xOk,232.739,2.97,we also have the Striga fights and the
CcpmD5J8xOk,234.299,3.481,fights in episode eights they do
CcpmD5J8xOk,235.709,3.661,certainly show a witch's skill in combat
CcpmD5J8xOk,237.78,4.26,which is always just cool to see on
CcpmD5J8xOk,239.37,4.859,screen I liked the actress playing ciri
CcpmD5J8xOk,242.04,3.27,although I do think she is a bit old and
CcpmD5J8xOk,244.229,3.211,it makes the father-daughter
CcpmD5J8xOk,245.31,4.019,relationship with Geralt feel not quite
CcpmD5J8xOk,247.44,3.93,as intimate to give you an idea she's
CcpmD5J8xOk,249.329,3.9,about as old now as ciri was at the end
CcpmD5J8xOk,251.37,4.5,of the books and were only at the start
CcpmD5J8xOk,253.229,4.68,but I do think she played ciri well and
CcpmD5J8xOk,255.87,4.38,I liked how our veteran her shed some
CcpmD5J8xOk,257.909,4.021,visual similarities now I'm gonna move
CcpmD5J8xOk,260.25,3.719,on to the things they changed and
CcpmD5J8xOk,261.93,4.38,personally I just wasn't really a big
CcpmD5J8xOk,263.969,4.681,fan of so for the first one pretty
CcpmD5J8xOk,266.31,4.41,everything with yennefer Paha scenes
CcpmD5J8xOk,268.65,4.35,involving Geralt was invented for the
CcpmD5J8xOk,270.72,3.75,show based on comments made by yennefer
CcpmD5J8xOk,273.0,3.75,and other characters throughout the
CcpmD5J8xOk,274.47,5.1,books and even then a lot was simply
CcpmD5J8xOk,276.75,4.919,made up I'm talking everything guys all
CcpmD5J8xOk,279.57,4.14,the scenes in our teaser simply don't
CcpmD5J8xOk,281.669,3.811,happen at least we were never shown them
CcpmD5J8xOk,283.71,3.78,happening the Battle of sodden at the
CcpmD5J8xOk,285.48,4.35,end was never shown just talked about
CcpmD5J8xOk,287.49,4.98,and just everything involving yennefer
CcpmD5J8xOk,289.83,4.32,by herself without girl was invented by
CcpmD5J8xOk,292.47,3.449,the show or all the scenes were
CcpmD5J8xOk,294.15,3.48,embellished massively from offhand
CcpmD5J8xOk,295.919,3.451,comments made throughout the book as
CcpmD5J8xOk,297.63,3.539,Jennifer's a bit more mysterious in the
CcpmD5J8xOk,299.37,3.36,books and it's less like okay here's
CcpmD5J8xOk,301.169,3.181,everything about yennefer from start to
CcpmD5J8xOk,302.73,3.689,finish a lot of the things about her
CcpmD5J8xOk,304.35,3.42,implied she's a bit more mysterious and
CcpmD5J8xOk,306.419,2.941,personally I think that makes her seem a
CcpmD5J8xOk,307.77,3.27,lot more strong as it doesn't really
CcpmD5J8xOk,309.36,3.57,matter where she came from all that
CcpmD5J8xOk,311.04,3.51,matters is what she's like now it's
CcpmD5J8xOk,312.93,3.239,similar to Geralt in that way we don't
CcpmD5J8xOk,314.55,3.36,really find out that much about what he
CcpmD5J8xOk,316.169,3.121,was like before he was a Witcher but
CcpmD5J8xOk,317.91,4.02,obviously they changed that in the show
CcpmD5J8xOk,319.29,4.83,as well I do understand that they wanted
CcpmD5J8xOk,321.93,4.739,to present her as a main character on
CcpmD5J8xOk,324.12,4.44,the same level as Geralt but for me the
CcpmD5J8xOk,326.669,3.481,books were always about Sirian Geralt
CcpmD5J8xOk,328.56,3.39,and occasionally there was some short
CcpmD5J8xOk,330.15,3.54,bits with other characters like yennefer
CcpmD5J8xOk,331.95,3.51,in the earlier short stories which
CcpmD5J8xOk,333.69,3.84,season one is about that the focus is
CcpmD5J8xOk,335.46,3.84,pretty much entirely on Geralt in the
CcpmD5J8xOk,337.53,3.78,books there were stories involving the
CcpmD5J8xOk,339.3,3.57,other characters but Garrett was always
CcpmD5J8xOk,341.31,3.75,there throughout and had a major role in
CcpmD5J8xOk,342.87,4.08,all of it number two in the show
CcpmD5J8xOk,345.06,4.08,nilfgaard was thought of as this kind of
CcpmD5J8xOk,346.95,3.87,weak Kingdom for some reason prior to
CcpmD5J8xOk,349.14,3.72,the invasion of sintra and it only
CcpmD5J8xOk,350.82,4.2,developed in power apparently due to
CcpmD5J8xOk,352.86,4.38,friend Jilla being posted there this is
CcpmD5J8xOk,355.02,4.53,also just wrong in the books for Angela
CcpmD5J8xOk,357.24,4.38,did not train an era to sir she is from
CcpmD5J8xOk,359.55,4.26,the Empire of nilfgaard and even during
CcpmD5J8xOk,361.62,3.48,the time of the usurper nilfgaard wasn't
CcpmD5J8xOk,363.81,2.7,this backwater place
CcpmD5J8xOk,365.1,3.21,I think they literally described it as a
CcpmD5J8xOk,366.51,3.83,backwater place it still had his own
CcpmD5J8xOk,368.31,3.99,culture and was still fairly powerful
CcpmD5J8xOk,370.34,4.15,nilfgaard has also portrayed as this
CcpmD5J8xOk,372.3,4.35,sort of strange nation that uses for a
CcpmD5J8xOk,374.49,4.71,bit of magic to achieve their goals this
CcpmD5J8xOk,376.65,5.1,is also just incorrect now if God is not
CcpmD5J8xOk,379.2,4.2,evil in the books they did use magic at
CcpmD5J8xOk,381.75,3.3,the Battle of sodom hill but they didn't
CcpmD5J8xOk,383.4,3.78,use people's life force to turn them
CcpmD5J8xOk,385.05,4.23,into balls and then catapult them at the
CcpmD5J8xOk,387.18,4.29,enemy that is just ridiculous
CcpmD5J8xOk,389.28,4.009,they're just another nation invading the
CcpmD5J8xOk,391.47,4.08,northern kingdoms the books don't
CcpmD5J8xOk,393.289,4.511,necessarily frame them as this thing
CcpmD5J8xOk,395.55,4.38,that is inherently bad they are framed
CcpmD5J8xOk,397.8,3.78,as this kind of invading army and then
CcpmD5J8xOk,399.93,3.329,you can consider that bad in your own
CcpmD5J8xOk,401.58,3.42,personal opinion but it's never a
CcpmD5J8xOk,403.259,3.841,straight cut as they're literally using
CcpmD5J8xOk,405.0,3.9,forbidden magic and sacrificing people
CcpmD5J8xOk,407.1,3.99,in order to do so basically if you look
CcpmD5J8xOk,408.9,4.44,into it the northern kingdoms are just
CcpmD5J8xOk,411.09,3.72,as bad as nilfgaard in the books and if
CcpmD5J8xOk,413.34,4.35,anything no if god are actually better
CcpmD5J8xOk,414.81,4.889,in some areas I mean as I said in the
CcpmD5J8xOk,417.69,3.69,show it's very much presented as an us
CcpmD5J8xOk,419.699,3.241,against them sort of situation with
CcpmD5J8xOk,421.38,3.599,nilfgaard z-- and they're also being
CcpmD5J8xOk,422.94,4.289,shown as this nation that only achieved
CcpmD5J8xOk,424.979,5.22,its power because of some mage which is
CcpmD5J8xOk,427.229,5.731,just wrong number three series story was
CcpmD5J8xOk,430.199,4.771,very inaccurate there is a lot that is
CcpmD5J8xOk,432.96,3.69,wrong with Ceres story but the main
CcpmD5J8xOk,434.97,3.36,problem is the fact that her entire
CcpmD5J8xOk,436.65,4.29,Brocklin adventure with Geralt was
CcpmD5J8xOk,438.33,4.559,removed in the books this story is the
CcpmD5J8xOk,440.94,4.05,first time at Geralt and ciri have a
CcpmD5J8xOk,442.889,4.441,proper conversation and they properly
CcpmD5J8xOk,444.99,3.78,bond and it's such a significant thing
CcpmD5J8xOk,447.33,3.36,for them in the books because it's
CcpmD5J8xOk,448.77,4.35,basically the beginning of their proper
CcpmD5J8xOk,450.69,4.08,father/daughter relationship for me the
CcpmD5J8xOk,453.12,3.479,end scene of episode eights had very
CcpmD5J8xOk,454.77,3.959,little emotional impacts as the
CcpmD5J8xOk,456.599,3.6,relationship between Syrian Geralt was
CcpmD5J8xOk,458.729,3.511,just based on the lore of surprise
CcpmD5J8xOk,460.199,4.171,whereas in the books of course the lore
CcpmD5J8xOk,462.24,4.109,of surprise was a significant thing but
CcpmD5J8xOk,464.37,4.169,girl only really grew to properly care
CcpmD5J8xOk,466.349,4.021,for her after their time in bracha lon
CcpmD5J8xOk,468.539,3.75,just like with the ennifer basically
CcpmD5J8xOk,470.37,4.2,every scene involving her that didn't
CcpmD5J8xOk,472.289,4.261,involve garel was not shown to us in the
CcpmD5J8xOk,474.57,3.81,books and in some cases it was just
CcpmD5J8xOk,476.55,3.839,completely made up a lot of what
CcpmD5J8xOk,478.38,4.23,happened involving her character was
CcpmD5J8xOk,480.389,3.96,referenced later in the books but never
CcpmD5J8xOk,482.61,3.69,shown to the extent that it was shown in
CcpmD5J8xOk,484.349,3.57,the show an exception would be when car
CcpmD5J8xOk,486.3,3.359,here is chasing her during the slaughter
CcpmD5J8xOk,487.919,3.75,of sintra but even that was portrayed
CcpmD5J8xOk,489.659,3.961,incorrectly they had Suri end up in
CcpmD5J8xOk,491.669,4.261,Brooklyn after the slaughter of Sentra
CcpmD5J8xOk,493.62,4.71,which just didn't happen in the books as
CcpmD5J8xOk,495.93,3.9,did many things I find it so weird they
CcpmD5J8xOk,498.33,2.519,made this change and if you actually
CcpmD5J8xOk,499.83,2.91,think about it
CcpmD5J8xOk,500.849,4.531,ciri going to Brock alone in the show
CcpmD5J8xOk,502.74,5.1,was just completely pointless she just
CcpmD5J8xOk,505.38,3.81,left Brock Alan to find Geralt which is
CcpmD5J8xOk,507.84,3.15,what she was doing when she went there
CcpmD5J8xOk,509.19,3.75,in the books this was where she met
CcpmD5J8xOk,510.99,4.5,Garrett properly I mean it seems to me
CcpmD5J8xOk,512.94,4.26,the entire dopler subplot and everything
CcpmD5J8xOk,515.49,4.08,there could just be completely removed
CcpmD5J8xOk,517.2,4.11,and nothing would change obviously all
CcpmD5J8xOk,519.57,3.389,that stuff just wasn't in the books and
CcpmD5J8xOk,521.31,3.089,at the end of the season she gets to the
CcpmD5J8xOk,522.959,3.271,point where the story in the books got
CcpmD5J8xOk,524.399,4.201,her to so it just seems like very
CcpmD5J8xOk,526.23,4.229,unnecessary things to be adding number
CcpmD5J8xOk,528.6,3.47,four this brings me to one of the worst
CcpmD5J8xOk,530.459,4.221,things in the show and there
CcpmD5J8xOk,532.07,4.56,is the portrayal of Kay here now I've
CcpmD5J8xOk,534.68,3.45,heard a lot of people say that early on
CcpmD5J8xOk,536.63,3.66,in The Witcher books he was thought to
CcpmD5J8xOk,538.13,4.38,be this evil figure at least from series
CcpmD5J8xOk,540.29,3.78,point of view and whilst this is true I
CcpmD5J8xOk,542.51,3.93,feel like whoever argues this is
CcpmD5J8xOk,544.07,4.02,purposely ignoring key details in order
CcpmD5J8xOk,546.44,3.06,to put up a fairly shoddy defense of
CcpmD5J8xOk,548.09,3.93,this characters portrayal in the show
CcpmD5J8xOk,549.5,5.04,first of all early on in the books Kay
CcpmD5J8xOk,552.02,4.38,here was not really explained or showed
CcpmD5J8xOk,554.54,4.08,in all that much detail he was like a
CcpmD5J8xOk,556.4,4.17,figment of series nightmares meaning he
CcpmD5J8xOk,558.62,4.35,was real but in the mind of serious
CcpmD5J8xOk,560.57,4.8,cared child he became one of her fears
CcpmD5J8xOk,562.97,4.86,in the show we actually see him walking
CcpmD5J8xOk,565.37,4.14,around interacting with people taking
CcpmD5J8xOk,567.83,4.02,part in battles he didn't in the books
CcpmD5J8xOk,569.51,4.86,and he is always presented as this evil
CcpmD5J8xOk,571.85,3.93,guy just from his actions alone I know a
CcpmD5J8xOk,574.37,3.12,lot of people are saying that it's only
CcpmD5J8xOk,575.78,3.27,season one and they're gonna change his
CcpmD5J8xOk,577.49,3.39,whole character in the latest seasons
CcpmD5J8xOk,579.05,3.96,and stuff but the way I see it just
CcpmD5J8xOk,580.88,4.56,based on what he's done so far it feels
CcpmD5J8xOk,583.01,4.41,so out of character from the car here we
CcpmD5J8xOk,585.44,4.74,know in the books but it's just so weird
CcpmD5J8xOk,587.42,4.47,to me already number five the next point
CcpmD5J8xOk,590.18,3.33,I want to make is that most of the
CcpmD5J8xOk,591.89,3.99,stories that are shown in the show are
CcpmD5J8xOk,593.51,3.93,simply being told incorrectly to list a
CcpmD5J8xOk,595.88,3.48,couple there's the portrayal of fall
CcpmD5J8xOk,597.44,3.99,test in the Striga story and from this
CcpmD5J8xOk,599.36,3.93,image need i say more there's also the
CcpmD5J8xOk,601.43,3.84,golden dragon story where Borch was
CcpmD5J8xOk,603.29,3.78,portrayed as an old man for some reason
CcpmD5J8xOk,605.27,3.9,I cough Danelle was killed early on
CcpmD5J8xOk,607.07,3.81,bought Chas a golden dragon didn't
CcpmD5J8xOk,609.17,3.45,really show his chivalrous side by
CcpmD5J8xOk,610.88,2.34,challenging people to duels as a golden
CcpmD5J8xOk,612.62,3.33,dragon
CcpmD5J8xOk,613.22,4.5,he just got geralt and yennefer on
CcpmD5J8xOk,615.95,3.6,almost immediately after revealing
CcpmD5J8xOk,617.72,3.36,himself to be a golden dragon in the
CcpmD5J8xOk,619.55,3.18,books there was proper interactions
CcpmD5J8xOk,621.08,3.96,between all the groups of the characters
CcpmD5J8xOk,622.73,4.26,and it was just way more developed I
CcpmD5J8xOk,625.04,4.26,mean it feels like they've just removed
CcpmD5J8xOk,626.99,3.78,development almost entirely and you can
CcpmD5J8xOk,629.3,3.27,say well you know they only had eight
CcpmD5J8xOk,630.77,3.54,episodes etc but then we have all this
CcpmD5J8xOk,632.57,3.87,random stuff with the N effort that just
CcpmD5J8xOk,634.31,3.78,was not needed for her character
CcpmD5J8xOk,636.44,3.75,I mean look guys I could sit here all
CcpmD5J8xOk,638.09,3.63,day at saying everything that was wrong
CcpmD5J8xOk,640.19,3.45,with each story but it would just be
CcpmD5J8xOk,641.72,3.33,pointless I understand that they can't
CcpmD5J8xOk,643.64,4.23,stick to the script of each story
CcpmD5J8xOk,645.05,4.59,exactly as this is an adaptation but for
CcpmD5J8xOk,647.87,3.75,me the problem lies in the fact said
CcpmD5J8xOk,649.64,4.53,that they made so many unnecessary
CcpmD5J8xOk,651.62,4.44,changes I've only really covered the tip
CcpmD5J8xOk,654.17,3.96,of the iceberg here I mean just to name
CcpmD5J8xOk,656.06,3.93,a couple more they changed the way magic
CcpmD5J8xOk,658.13,3.81,works making it some sort of strange
CcpmD5J8xOk,659.99,4.17,equivalent exchange thing with life
CcpmD5J8xOk,661.94,3.48,whereas in the books may just happen to
CcpmD5J8xOk,664.16,3.45,sources and channel
CcpmD5J8xOk,665.42,3.48,power to use magic I mean I can't
CcpmD5J8xOk,667.61,2.7,imagine how they're gonna do the core
CcpmD5J8xOk,668.9,3.66,earth desert thing because theoretically
CcpmD5J8xOk,670.31,3.87,when series in the desert and she has to
CcpmD5J8xOk,672.56,3.57,use magic she could just pick up some
CcpmD5J8xOk,674.18,3.15,random shrub and start using it whereas
CcpmD5J8xOk,676.13,2.76,in the book she had to search for
CcpmD5J8xOk,677.33,3.42,sources in the ground it was an entire
CcpmD5J8xOk,678.89,3.54,thing I just I don't see how it's gonna
CcpmD5J8xOk,680.75,3.12,work unless they just make major changes
CcpmD5J8xOk,682.43,2.91,which are sort of mess with the
CcpmD5J8xOk,683.87,3.39,established world they're trying to make
CcpmD5J8xOk,685.34,3.66,with this show and therefore that entire
CcpmD5J8xOk,687.26,3.09,desert thing is just kind of pointless
CcpmD5J8xOk,689.0,3.06,and if you don't know what I'm talking
CcpmD5J8xOk,690.35,3.51,about I won't get into it as it is
CcpmD5J8xOk,692.06,3.21,spoiler territory for later on but I
CcpmD5J8xOk,693.86,3.09,haven't really said anything important
CcpmD5J8xOk,695.27,4.29,so don't worry they also invented
CcpmD5J8xOk,696.95,4.65,characters like the elf with Siri the
CcpmD5J8xOk,699.56,4.05,girl guiding galton bladvic and they
CcpmD5J8xOk,701.6,4.32,also just changed so many characters
CcpmD5J8xOk,703.61,4.17,stories I talked about main characters
CcpmD5J8xOk,705.92,3.63,and some relatively minor characters
CcpmD5J8xOk,707.78,3.6,like Frank killer but also I could use
CcpmD5J8xOk,709.55,3.72,Strega Bohr as an example as he was
CcpmD5J8xOk,711.38,4.5,given a much bigger role they changed
CcpmD5J8xOk,713.27,4.68,vilgax's story and despite adding all
CcpmD5J8xOk,715.88,3.51,this stuff they also just removed a lot
CcpmD5J8xOk,717.95,3.75,of stuff that they could have brought
CcpmD5J8xOk,719.39,3.78,from the source material so honestly I'm
CcpmD5J8xOk,721.7,2.67,just really confused about whatever the
CcpmD5J8xOk,723.17,3.39,writer was thinking when they were
CcpmD5J8xOk,724.37,4.02,making it I know a lot of my mentions
CcpmD5J8xOk,726.56,2.55,towards the end there may come across as
CcpmD5J8xOk,728.39,2.46,nitpicks
CcpmD5J8xOk,729.11,3.63,but the reason I mention them is just to
CcpmD5J8xOk,730.85,3.84,give you an idea of a fraction of the
CcpmD5J8xOk,732.74,3.84,things they changed I'm telling you guys
CcpmD5J8xOk,734.69,4.41,if you wanted me to make a very nitpicky
CcpmD5J8xOk,736.58,4.05,video I could I'm just saying the basic
CcpmD5J8xOk,739.1,3.21,things here guys at least that's what
CcpmD5J8xOk,740.63,3.27,I'm trying to do I mean another thing
CcpmD5J8xOk,742.31,3.27,I've just thought about kay here is that
CcpmD5J8xOk,743.9,3.63,he actually beat vulgar faults in a
CcpmD5J8xOk,745.58,5.04,fight which if you've read the books is
CcpmD5J8xOk,747.53,4.47,just absolutely ridiculous I mean Geralt
CcpmD5J8xOk,750.62,3.42,couldn't beat Volga forts in a fight
CcpmD5J8xOk,752.0,4.47,without the assistance of magic so we
CcpmD5J8xOk,754.04,3.93,saying that kay here is just the best I
CcpmD5J8xOk,756.47,3.9,just don't understand what they're doing
CcpmD5J8xOk,757.97,4.41,with Kay here guys so confusing but
CcpmD5J8xOk,760.37,5.37,anyway after saying all of those issues
CcpmD5J8xOk,762.38,5.49,my initial point still stands I think as
CcpmD5J8xOk,765.74,3.75,a fantasy show I can understand why
CcpmD5J8xOk,767.87,3.24,people who haven't read the books and
CcpmD5J8xOk,769.49,4.14,people who are not too familiar with the
CcpmD5J8xOk,771.11,4.53,law enjoy I imagine most people watching
CcpmD5J8xOk,773.63,4.14,it came from the games and maybe just
CcpmD5J8xOk,775.64,4.23,think ah a cool bunch of stories
CcpmD5J8xOk,777.77,3.75,involving Geralt yennefer and ciri that
CcpmD5J8xOk,779.87,3.27,i've never really known about this is
CcpmD5J8xOk,781.52,3.36,awesome and people watching it who've
CcpmD5J8xOk,783.14,3.9,never experienced The Witcher I'll
CcpmD5J8xOk,784.88,4.56,pretty just think ah a nice new fantasy
CcpmD5J8xOk,787.04,4.53,TV show that has a decent budget this is
CcpmD5J8xOk,789.44,3.96,pretty cool but for me as someone who is
CcpmD5J8xOk,791.57,4.05,invested in the lore of this world and
CcpmD5J8xOk,793.4,4.62,the characters I discussing it is
CcpmD5J8xOk,795.62,3.54,literally my job I can't bring myself to
CcpmD5J8xOk,798.02,2.97,enjoy it
CcpmD5J8xOk,799.16,3.419,everything is so different all the
CcpmD5J8xOk,800.99,3.57,characters journeys have been changed
CcpmD5J8xOk,802.579,3.661,with the exception of Geralt but even
CcpmD5J8xOk,804.56,3.48,then the journey we see him going in
CcpmD5J8xOk,806.24,3.48,this series is pretty different to his
CcpmD5J8xOk,808.04,3.18,journey in the books me I mentioned
CcpmD5J8xOk,809.72,3.299,earlier about how we see Geralt when
CcpmD5J8xOk,811.22,5.07,he's younger sitting in a car talking to
CcpmD5J8xOk,813.019,4.711,his mum being kind of annoying and we
CcpmD5J8xOk,816.29,3.2,just don't need to know this for girls
CcpmD5J8xOk,817.73,4.049,character it's just very unnecessary
CcpmD5J8xOk,819.49,4.0,information that feels like it's kind of
CcpmD5J8xOk,821.779,3.451,just there to build drama between him
CcpmD5J8xOk,823.49,3.539,and his mother that just wasn't really
CcpmD5J8xOk,825.23,3.69,there the books did a good job of
CcpmD5J8xOk,827.029,3.81,explaining this is Geralt some mum they
CcpmD5J8xOk,828.92,3.33,have a brief interaction and that's it
CcpmD5J8xOk,830.839,3.571,it doesn't need to be this very dramatic
CcpmD5J8xOk,832.25,4.589,girls thinking about his childhood I
CcpmD5J8xOk,834.41,4.349,just I just disagree with it guys in my
CcpmD5J8xOk,836.839,4.05,last video I did see a few comments
CcpmD5J8xOk,838.759,3.93,telling me our nitpicking that I need to
CcpmD5J8xOk,840.889,4.231,change my attitude and should just be
CcpmD5J8xOk,842.689,4.08,more positive about it and to that I say
CcpmD5J8xOk,845.12,3.75,that I am allowed to dislike something
CcpmD5J8xOk,846.769,3.69,just as you are allowed to like here and
CcpmD5J8xOk,848.87,3.959,I also want to say that I don't think
CcpmD5J8xOk,850.459,4.711,anybody is wrong for liking this show
CcpmD5J8xOk,852.829,4.351,you have every right to like it and that
CcpmD5J8xOk,855.17,4.44,goes for everyone there is plenty to
CcpmD5J8xOk,857.18,4.019,like in this show it's just for me as
CcpmD5J8xOk,859.61,3.39,someone that knows this books and knows
CcpmD5J8xOk,861.199,3.87,the stories it just doesn't feel like
CcpmD5J8xOk,863.0,4.38,The Witcher and that's my problem with
CcpmD5J8xOk,865.069,4.351,it so it's saying that don't let my
CcpmD5J8xOk,867.38,3.84,opinion become yours if you like the
CcpmD5J8xOk,869.42,3.51,show I encourage you to just have your
CcpmD5J8xOk,871.22,2.58,own thoughts on the show and I really
CcpmD5J8xOk,872.93,3.3,like that everyone has different
CcpmD5J8xOk,873.8,4.529,opinions on it read the books play the
CcpmD5J8xOk,876.23,3.589,games watch the show and then decide for
CcpmD5J8xOk,878.329,4.591,yourself if you think it's good or not
CcpmD5J8xOk,879.819,5.531,personally I don't like it but if you do
CcpmD5J8xOk,882.92,4.26,that's fine for people who haven't read
CcpmD5J8xOk,885.35,3.45,the books and I'm wondering if this show
CcpmD5J8xOk,887.18,3.06,will act as a good supplement for
CcpmD5J8xOk,888.8,3.149,knowing some of Garrett's backstory
CcpmD5J8xOk,890.24,2.909,before entering the games or if you've
CcpmD5J8xOk,891.949,2.521,played the games and you just want to
CcpmD5J8xOk,893.149,3.54,know girls and the other characters
CcpmD5J8xOk,894.47,4.41,backstories I would personally not
CcpmD5J8xOk,896.689,4.051,recommend this show for that purpose my
CcpmD5J8xOk,898.88,3.87,main reason for this is because although
CcpmD5J8xOk,900.74,3.959,a lot of information about Daryl is told
CcpmD5J8xOk,902.75,4.529,to us in this show it is fairly accurate
CcpmD5J8xOk,904.699,4.95,in truthful the show as a whole is also
CcpmD5J8xOk,907.279,3.841,full of misinformation that surrounding
CcpmD5J8xOk,909.649,3.151,The Witcher law that I think would put
CcpmD5J8xOk,911.12,3.449,you in a bad position if you want to
CcpmD5J8xOk,912.8,3.719,understand the Witcher games to the
CcpmD5J8xOk,914.569,3.63,fullest extent for example if you
CcpmD5J8xOk,916.519,3.661,believe that an era tuza they turn
CcpmD5J8xOk,918.199,3.301,Sorceress's into eels and throw them in
CcpmD5J8xOk,920.18,3.54,a pool you would just be completely
CcpmD5J8xOk,921.5,4.439,wrong in regards to the game and book
CcpmD5J8xOk,923.72,5.14,law basically what I'm saying is it's
CcpmD5J8xOk,925.939,4.661,better to know nothing than half-truths
CcpmD5J8xOk,928.86,3.93,imagine seeing nilfgaard in the show
CcpmD5J8xOk,930.6,4.02,they used forbidden magic and we are
CcpmD5J8xOk,932.79,3.66,told they were a backwater place before
CcpmD5J8xOk,934.62,3.6,fringe Allura arrived and also now i
CcpmD5J8xOk,936.45,3.54,think about it it's heavily implied that
CcpmD5J8xOk,938.22,2.43,yennefer would have basically screwed up
CcpmD5J8xOk,939.99,2.79,nilfgaard
CcpmD5J8xOk,940.65,4.29,and kept it as this horrible place and i
CcpmD5J8xOk,942.78,3.81,just think that is so bad for universe
CcpmD5J8xOk,944.94,2.34,character because she would have done a
CcpmD5J8xOk,946.59,3.06,good job
CcpmD5J8xOk,947.28,3.81,yennefer is completely competent i do
CcpmD5J8xOk,949.65,2.82,not understand what they're trying to
CcpmD5J8xOk,951.09,3.39,say about all these characters in the
CcpmD5J8xOk,952.47,3.75,show it is so weird for me as someone
CcpmD5J8xOk,954.48,3.24,who knows them all but anyway thinking
CcpmD5J8xOk,956.22,3.36,about the whole backwater fringe killer
CcpmD5J8xOk,957.72,3.48,thing imagine when you meet a mirror in
CcpmD5J8xOk,959.58,3.45,the witcher 3 you would have such a
CcpmD5J8xOk,961.2,3.63,different opinion of him which is based
CcpmD5J8xOk,963.03,4.02,on something that is not true in regards
CcpmD5J8xOk,964.83,3.6,to the game and book universe the same
CcpmD5J8xOk,967.05,3.42,applies for you when you meet friend
CcpmD5J8xOk,968.43,3.15,euler in the games - so that whole bit
CcpmD5J8xOk,970.47,2.4,there was just with people that play the
CcpmD5J8xOk,971.58,2.67,games obviously if you just want to
CcpmD5J8xOk,972.87,3.78,watch the show and have it as a separate
CcpmD5J8xOk,974.25,3.69,thing that's fine as i said no problem
CcpmD5J8xOk,976.65,3.06,there just some people that want to play
CcpmD5J8xOk,977.94,3.72,the games and understand the world the
CcpmD5J8xOk,979.71,3.96,show is not really a way to do that so
CcpmD5J8xOk,981.66,5.19,games aside would I recommend watching
CcpmD5J8xOk,983.67,5.07,this show I guess if you're interested
CcpmD5J8xOk,986.85,3.96,in fantasy I think it's better to watch
CcpmD5J8xOk,988.74,3.84,it yourself and from your own opinion if
CcpmD5J8xOk,990.81,3.84,you're interested in watching the show I
CcpmD5J8xOk,992.58,3.78,didn't like it but that doesn't mean you
CcpmD5J8xOk,994.65,4.02,won't as there is plenty to like about
CcpmD5J8xOk,996.36,4.26,this show but for me seeing all the
CcpmD5J8xOk,998.67,3.93,extensive changes that every corner
CcpmD5J8xOk,1000.62,3.81,makes it very difficult for me to enjoy
CcpmD5J8xOk,1002.6,3.63,it I know people are gonna get annoyed
CcpmD5J8xOk,1004.43,3.45,at me I've had people tell me the game's
CcpmD5J8xOk,1006.23,2.91,changed some law and the Lord of the
CcpmD5J8xOk,1007.88,2.76,Rings was different to the lot of the
CcpmD5J8xOk,1009.14,2.79,Rings books or something but for the
CcpmD5J8xOk,1010.64,3.09,games I don't think that's really a
CcpmD5J8xOk,1011.93,3.57,relevant point as they're not adapting
CcpmD5J8xOk,1013.73,3.6,the story they made games as like an
CcpmD5J8xOk,1015.5,4.14,alternate universe sequel type thing
CcpmD5J8xOk,1017.33,3.9,it's not canon to the books but it could
CcpmD5J8xOk,1019.64,3.84,be and if you want it to be can in your
CcpmD5J8xOk,1021.23,4.05,head it can I feel like bringing up an
CcpmD5J8xOk,1023.48,3.87,argument like that is kind of like
CcpmD5J8xOk,1025.28,4.47,imagine they remade the original Star
CcpmD5J8xOk,1027.35,3.78,Wars films and I said I didn't like them
CcpmD5J8xOk,1029.75,4.08,because of the changes they made to the
CcpmD5J8xOk,1031.13,4.89,characters then someone said well you
CcpmD5J8xOk,1033.83,3.69,like Luke Skywalker in the last Jedi so
CcpmD5J8xOk,1036.02,3.33,why don't you like him in the remake
CcpmD5J8xOk,1037.52,3.39,they changed him in the last Jedi they
CcpmD5J8xOk,1039.35,3.81,change him in the remake is the same
CcpmD5J8xOk,1040.91,3.57,thing right well no because the remake
CcpmD5J8xOk,1043.16,3.39,is based on something that already
CcpmD5J8xOk,1044.48,4.68,exists and the characters were that way
CcpmD5J8xOk,1046.55,4.56,in that thing that existed in sequels
CcpmD5J8xOk,1049.16,3.93,those characters can change new things
CcpmD5J8xOk,1051.11,3.51,can be introduced but if you're adapting
CcpmD5J8xOk,1053.09,3.48,something and then adding a bunch of
CcpmD5J8xOk,1054.62,3.9,stuff it just feels really weird to me
CcpmD5J8xOk,1056.57,3.78,it's a completely pointless points and
CcpmD5J8xOk,1058.52,2.88,just so you know I didn't like Luke in
CcpmD5J8xOk,1060.35,2.76,the last Jedi but I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1061.4,3.72,think my example illustrates why it's a
CcpmD5J8xOk,1063.11,3.9,pointless point to make as for the Lord
CcpmD5J8xOk,1065.12,3.63,of the Rings all I can say is I think
CcpmD5J8xOk,1067.01,4.08,the films are great and I haven't read
CcpmD5J8xOk,1068.75,4.29,the books yet I really need to but I've
CcpmD5J8xOk,1071.09,3.69,just been so busy for these past two
CcpmD5J8xOk,1073.04,3.63,years and it's been on my wish list of
CcpmD5J8xOk,1074.78,4.26,things to do I do actually own a copy
CcpmD5J8xOk,1076.67,4.11,and I literally keep it by my bed every
CcpmD5J8xOk,1079.04,2.79,night but I just never get the time to
CcpmD5J8xOk,1080.78,2.37,read it you know there's always
CcpmD5J8xOk,1081.83,2.13,something else to do there's always more
CcpmD5J8xOk,1083.15,2.55,work to do
CcpmD5J8xOk,1083.96,3.3,always other things to do all the stuff
CcpmD5J8xOk,1085.7,3.06,to watch all the rest it's just very
CcpmD5J8xOk,1087.26,3.24,difficult for me to find the time to
CcpmD5J8xOk,1088.76,3.99,read a book that big with how busy I've
CcpmD5J8xOk,1090.5,5.1,been so I'm sorry about that so to
CcpmD5J8xOk,1092.75,4.41,conclude I didn't enjoy the show nor did
CcpmD5J8xOk,1095.6,3.21,I think it was a truthful adaption of
CcpmD5J8xOk,1097.16,3.36,the source material I think someone
CcpmD5J8xOk,1098.81,4.35,Twitter actually described it best to me
CcpmD5J8xOk,1100.52,4.71,it's inspired by the original book not
CcpmD5J8xOk,1103.16,4.08,based on it and for me that's not the
CcpmD5J8xOk,1105.23,3.99,Witcher I love I think you could use
CcpmD5J8xOk,1107.24,2.88,that mindset and say well just think of
CcpmD5J8xOk,1109.22,2.43,it as something that's completely
CcpmD5J8xOk,1110.12,2.31,different and try and enjoy it in that
CcpmD5J8xOk,1111.65,2.04,regard
CcpmD5J8xOk,1112.43,2.64,but I just can't do that because
CcpmD5J8xOk,1113.69,3.33,obviously I hear the names yennefer I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1115.07,3.9,hear Geralt are here ciri I see places
CcpmD5J8xOk,1117.02,3.75,like our teaser I hear the name is Brock
CcpmD5J8xOk,1118.97,3.9,Alan and it's very difficult for me to
CcpmD5J8xOk,1120.77,3.57,disconnect the two things and therefore
CcpmD5J8xOk,1122.87,3.39,all I can see the changes that I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1124.34,4.29,disagree with but that's it for today's
CcpmD5J8xOk,1126.26,3.99,video guys unless there is a significant
CcpmD5J8xOk,1128.63,3.27,demand I'll probably be releasing
CcpmD5J8xOk,1130.25,3.54,another which a lore video next or a
CcpmD5J8xOk,1131.9,3.66,playthrough part next but I'm sure I'll
CcpmD5J8xOk,1133.79,3.63,talk about the Netflix series in future
CcpmD5J8xOk,1135.56,3.81,so stay tuned for that I mean who knows
CcpmD5J8xOk,1137.42,3.75,maybe one season two releases and they
CcpmD5J8xOk,1139.37,3.48,adapt some more source material they'll
CcpmD5J8xOk,1141.17,3.12,stick to it a bit more and I'll actually
CcpmD5J8xOk,1142.85,3.45,really enjoy it and then be able to make
CcpmD5J8xOk,1144.29,3.99,videos about there I really appreciate
CcpmD5J8xOk,1146.3,4.14,you liking today's video just to support
CcpmD5J8xOk,1148.28,4.29,me to be honest guys making videos like
CcpmD5J8xOk,1150.44,3.78,this is always difficult for me as I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1152.57,3.33,really don't like causing upset in
CcpmD5J8xOk,1154.22,3.48,others I know that might make me seem a
CcpmD5J8xOk,1155.9,3.69,bit sensitive in a bit you know but I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1157.7,3.6,just I really don't like to see comments
CcpmD5J8xOk,1159.59,3.21,so people aren't actually upset and it's
CcpmD5J8xOk,1161.3,3.33,not because necessarily that it's
CcpmD5J8xOk,1162.8,3.75,offending me or anything it's just I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1164.63,4.05,think you know the video I made has made
CcpmD5J8xOk,1166.55,3.84,someone feel bad and I just I don't like
CcpmD5J8xOk,1168.68,3.12,doing that you know I like making lore
CcpmD5J8xOk,1170.39,3.27,videos that I'm very passionate about
CcpmD5J8xOk,1171.8,3.33,and we can just all share and in love
CcpmD5J8xOk,1173.66,3.21,and this is why I haven't covered the
CcpmD5J8xOk,1175.13,4.2,witcha Netflix and so long because it's
CcpmD5J8xOk,1176.87,4.26,just such a hot contentious topic and I
CcpmD5J8xOk,1179.33,3.63,just don't like upsetting people but
CcpmD5J8xOk,1181.13,3.81,still having said that The Witcher is so
CcpmD5J8xOk,1182.96,3.42,important to me so I feel like I have to
CcpmD5J8xOk,1184.94,3.24,share my opinion with my community
CcpmD5J8xOk,1186.38,3.93,despite the fact that I know this video
CcpmD5J8xOk,1188.18,3.87,is gonna get me a very negative response
CcpmD5J8xOk,1190.31,3.72,I'd of course love to see comments
CcpmD5J8xOk,1192.05,2.999,responding to what I've said and please
CcpmD5J8xOk,1194.03,2.999,try your best
CcpmD5J8xOk,1195.049,4.38,bond without anger I know it's hard but
CcpmD5J8xOk,1197.029,4.441,just know I don't dislike you for liking
CcpmD5J8xOk,1199.429,4.38,the show I don't judge you is not a true
CcpmD5J8xOk,1201.47,4.079,fan or anything like that all I think is
CcpmD5J8xOk,1203.809,3.48,we have different tastes but we can
CcpmD5J8xOk,1205.549,3.541,still be cool with each other I'd really

k5S62lVAuy8,0.24,3.199,are you gonna toss a coin to your
k5S62lVAuy8,1.52,4.319,witcher season two of the netflix
k5S62lVAuy8,3.439,3.611,fantasy adventure is just about here is
k5S62lVAuy8,5.839,3.661,it gonna be on your binge list
k5S62lVAuy8,7.05,5.479,[Music]
k5S62lVAuy8,9.5,3.029,[Applause]
k5S62lVAuy8,12.799,3.841,convinced jennifer's life was lost at
k5S62lVAuy8,14.719,3.921,the battle of sodom geralt brings
k5S62lVAuy8,16.64,4.399,princess cirilla to the safest place he
k5S62lVAuy8,18.64,4.719,knows his childhood home of caramorn
k5S62lVAuy8,21.039,4.48,while the continents kings elves humans
k5S62lVAuy8,23.359,4.321,and demons strive for supremacy outside
k5S62lVAuy8,25.519,4.16,its walls he must protect the girl from
k5S62lVAuy8,27.68,3.2,something far more dangerous so just
k5S62lVAuy8,29.679,2.961,like with the first season of the
k5S62lVAuy8,30.88,3.359,witcher i've still never played the
k5S62lVAuy8,32.64,3.28,games that this is based on nor have i
k5S62lVAuy8,34.239,3.201,read any of the books so i can't say how
k5S62lVAuy8,35.92,3.44,closely or not this sticks to the
k5S62lVAuy8,37.44,3.84,material that inspires it while season
k5S62lVAuy8,39.36,4.0,one had the crazy timelines for its
k5S62lVAuy8,41.28,3.68,storytelling this one is all on one
k5S62lVAuy8,43.36,3.6,timeline but there are still several
k5S62lVAuy8,44.96,4.0,story arcs that we bounce around to
k5S62lVAuy8,46.96,3.52,follow each work together to build out
k5S62lVAuy8,48.96,3.52,the world and that's where we see a lot
k5S62lVAuy8,50.48,4.239,of the political scheming coming into
k5S62lVAuy8,52.48,4.239,play but we also get to spend a great
k5S62lVAuy8,54.719,4.0,deal of time at caremoren and then
k5S62lVAuy8,56.719,3.921,traveling through the lands as yennefer
k5S62lVAuy8,58.719,3.921,is trying to make her way to find geralt
k5S62lVAuy8,60.64,4.08,the political scheming was enjoyable as
k5S62lVAuy8,62.64,4.479,we watch the elves and humans engage in
k5S62lVAuy8,64.72,4.8,a lot of strife and then arguments all
k5S62lVAuy8,67.119,4.32,surrounding trust and power the themes
k5S62lVAuy8,69.52,4.16,that are examined in this segment even
k5S62lVAuy8,71.439,4.481,hold relevance in today's world as
k5S62lVAuy8,73.68,4.799,powers vie for control and use
k5S62lVAuy8,75.92,4.72,misdirection doubt and gaslighting to
k5S62lVAuy8,78.479,4.0,propel their own plans forward one of
k5S62lVAuy8,80.64,4.08,the main focuses of the season is on
k5S62lVAuy8,82.479,4.561,geralt and siri and i really love the
k5S62lVAuy8,84.72,4.719,relationship and the dynamic between
k5S62lVAuy8,87.04,4.32,them it's caring but it's also tough and
k5S62lVAuy8,89.439,4.161,they work well together and i especially
k5S62lVAuy8,91.36,3.759,like how we're watching siri come into
k5S62lVAuy8,93.6,3.92,our own and not just want to be this
k5S62lVAuy8,95.119,4.64,helpless person who relies on her status
k5S62lVAuy8,97.52,4.08,or her lineage but someone who can fight
k5S62lVAuy8,99.759,4.481,and defend themselves but then that
k5S62lVAuy8,101.6,4.799,contrasts with what geralt knows comes
k5S62lVAuy8,104.24,4.08,from a life of battle it's great to
k5S62lVAuy8,106.399,4.241,watch their growth together as they both
k5S62lVAuy8,108.32,4.479,navigate the relationship where siri can
k5S62lVAuy8,110.64,4.24,learn and become a warrior but daryl
k5S62lVAuy8,112.799,3.841,guides and ultimately has to trust her
k5S62lVAuy8,114.88,3.919,and geralt is like this reluctant father
k5S62lVAuy8,116.64,3.92,who values his responsibility but is
k5S62lVAuy8,118.799,3.841,also torn at what the right direction
k5S62lVAuy8,120.56,4.48,truly is and then we still get to see
k5S62lVAuy8,122.64,4.159,some of the wordless grunts from him
k5S62lVAuy8,125.04,3.76,just to show his displeasure or his
k5S62lVAuy8,126.799,4.401,frustration and i love these because
k5S62lVAuy8,128.8,4.56,they speak so much without words and
k5S62lVAuy8,131.2,4.0,siri's journey is great to watch i found
k5S62lVAuy8,133.36,3.519,her storyline the most engaging and
k5S62lVAuy8,135.2,3.92,intriguing especially as we watch this
k5S62lVAuy8,136.879,4.161,young woman try to find where she fits
k5S62lVAuy8,139.12,4.72,in the world and she reminded me a bit
k5S62lVAuy8,141.04,4.72,of arya stark with just her ferocity and
k5S62lVAuy8,143.84,3.92,then her pursuit of growth there's also
k5S62lVAuy8,145.76,3.76,a ton of mystery surrounding siri and
k5S62lVAuy8,147.76,4.479,the memories or these visions that she
k5S62lVAuy8,149.52,4.799,sees they're vivid but also vague to
k5S62lVAuy8,152.239,4.161,help eek out the details just little by
k5S62lVAuy8,154.319,3.841,little but not in some frustrating way i
k5S62lVAuy8,156.4,4.16,mean there's just enough info that's
k5S62lVAuy8,158.16,4.4,given to keep moving the story forward
k5S62lVAuy8,160.56,3.6,but enough that's held back to keep us
k5S62lVAuy8,162.56,2.959,wanting more now as i mentioned there
k5S62lVAuy8,164.16,2.64,are a few story lines that we're
k5S62lVAuy8,165.519,3.44,following even though they're all
k5S62lVAuy8,166.8,3.92,happening on the same timeline and one
k5S62lVAuy8,168.959,3.681,of the largest is the witcher castle or
k5S62lVAuy8,170.72,3.599,the fortress like i had said caramora
k5S62lVAuy8,172.64,3.76,here we get to see a bunch of other
k5S62lVAuy8,174.319,3.92,witchers which is great to see geralt
k5S62lVAuy8,176.4,4.0,interact with them which just gives him
k5S62lVAuy8,178.239,4.72,more relatability because now he has a
k5S62lVAuy8,180.4,4.24,past and a history with people they rib
k5S62lVAuy8,182.959,4.161,each other share laughs but then they
k5S62lVAuy8,184.64,4.319,also relive memories and even battle
k5S62lVAuy8,187.12,3.6,together now i'm glad i had seen the
k5S62lVAuy8,188.959,3.681,animated movie the witcher nightmare of
k5S62lVAuy8,190.72,3.84,the wolf a few months ago because it
k5S62lVAuy8,192.64,3.92,filled in some of the world and the lore
k5S62lVAuy8,194.56,4.24,for me and it also introduced us to
k5S62lVAuy8,196.56,4.64,vesemir who then plays a fairly large
k5S62lVAuy8,198.8,4.4,role in part of this season i really
k5S62lVAuy8,201.2,4.399,enjoyed his storyline and the history
k5S62lVAuy8,203.2,4.8,and even tensions that he experiences
k5S62lVAuy8,205.599,4.72,with geralt and that relationship also
k5S62lVAuy8,208.0,4.239,helps to guide and influence geralt's
k5S62lVAuy8,210.319,4.081,relationship with siri now the creature
k5S62lVAuy8,212.239,4.321,designs are spectacular in the second
k5S62lVAuy8,214.4,4.08,season i mean they're all really unique
k5S62lVAuy8,216.56,3.679,and unsettling now i don't want to
k5S62lVAuy8,218.48,3.36,describe them to you so that you can be
k5S62lVAuy8,220.239,3.36,surprised when they appear but just
k5S62lVAuy8,221.84,4.72,suffice to say that they have
k5S62lVAuy8,223.599,5.36,characteristics that make them all wrong
k5S62lVAuy8,226.56,4.08,but oh so right now in addition to the
k5S62lVAuy8,228.959,4.081,storyline with geralt we're also
k5S62lVAuy8,230.64,4.72,watching jennifer try to make her way to
k5S62lVAuy8,233.04,4.32,find him after that crazy and bloody
k5S62lVAuy8,235.36,3.92,battle of sodom and her journey is
k5S62lVAuy8,237.36,3.92,mysterious trippy i mean it's
k5S62lVAuy8,239.28,3.92,frustrating even and then it's very
k5S62lVAuy8,241.28,3.76,entertaining she finds herself in
k5S62lVAuy8,243.2,4.56,several situations that are less than
k5S62lVAuy8,245.04,5.119,desirable but because of a complication
k5S62lVAuy8,247.76,4.0,she has to figure out new ways to adapt
k5S62lVAuy8,250.159,3.601,and i love what that meant for her
k5S62lVAuy8,251.76,4.08,character growth she's resourceful and
k5S62lVAuy8,253.76,4.4,even desperate at times which is a great
k5S62lVAuy8,255.84,4.239,motivator which then also adds wonderful
k5S62lVAuy8,258.16,4.08,drama to the story now one thing that
k5S62lVAuy8,260.079,4.961,was a bit odd to me was that after about
k5S62lVAuy8,262.24,4.72,episode three i think tasaya kind of
k5S62lVAuy8,265.04,3.84,just disappears from the story for a
k5S62lVAuy8,266.96,3.36,while and it's not weird that the
k5S62lVAuy8,268.88,3.12,narrative wouldn't put a great deal of
k5S62lVAuy8,270.32,3.599,focus on her because i mean with all the
k5S62lVAuy8,272.0,3.84,multiple storylines it's natural for
k5S62lVAuy8,273.919,4.401,some to take a back seat but the odd
k5S62lVAuy8,275.84,4.56,thing was how she and her arc were just
k5S62lVAuy8,278.32,3.84,noticeably absent for a while now in the
k5S62lVAuy8,280.4,4.0,screeners i got i only received the
k5S62lVAuy8,282.16,3.92,first six episodes so there are still
k5S62lVAuy8,284.4,3.68,two that i haven't seen as of this
k5S62lVAuy8,286.08,4.32,recording but the latter half of this
k5S62lVAuy8,288.08,4.16,season to me was much more captivating
k5S62lVAuy8,290.4,4.64,than the first half and it even began to
k5S62lVAuy8,292.24,5.36,feel this sense of urgency as something
k5S62lVAuy8,295.04,4.159,is building towards a big climax there's
k5S62lVAuy8,297.6,3.84,a lot of mystery involved with the
k5S62lVAuy8,299.199,4.161,visions and whispers and it was just
k5S62lVAuy8,301.44,4.56,sucking me in some of the action
k5S62lVAuy8,303.36,4.72,sequences are just bonkers in such a fun
k5S62lVAuy8,306.0,4.479,way as we get towards the finale in
k5S62lVAuy8,308.08,4.559,episode six there's this spectacular
k5S62lVAuy8,310.479,4.0,fight and the camera work is awesome the
k5S62lVAuy8,312.639,3.601,camera flies around the action so that
k5S62lVAuy8,314.479,4.321,we get to experience it from all sorts
k5S62lVAuy8,316.24,4.56,of angles which is then very engaging
k5S62lVAuy8,318.8,3.92,and the camera will also follow body
k5S62lVAuy8,320.8,4.08,movements which is another fun effect
k5S62lVAuy8,322.72,4.24,because it makes us sort of experience
k5S62lVAuy8,324.88,3.68,what the character is experiencing so if
k5S62lVAuy8,326.96,3.92,they are pounced on and they fall to
k5S62lVAuy8,328.56,4.479,their side the camera then follows them
k5S62lVAuy8,330.88,3.68,down and twists as their point of view
k5S62lVAuy8,333.039,3.521,changes and it's not just in that
k5S62lVAuy8,334.56,3.68,particular episode that we have a great
k5S62lVAuy8,336.56,3.359,battle with some good camera angles
k5S62lVAuy8,338.24,3.36,because there are multiple times that
k5S62lVAuy8,339.919,3.28,become exciting throughout the show this
k5S62lVAuy8,341.6,3.68,one just stood out to me more because it
k5S62lVAuy8,343.199,4.321,felt like a longer sequence and it was
k5S62lVAuy8,345.28,4.24,certainly more grand in scale now for me
k5S62lVAuy8,347.52,3.6,i enjoyed the second season a lot more
k5S62lVAuy8,349.52,2.8,than i did the first i think some of
k5S62lVAuy8,351.12,3.12,that had to do with just trying to
k5S62lVAuy8,352.32,4.319,figure out the whole world and then the
k5S62lVAuy8,354.24,4.48,the weird timelines and honestly if i
k5S62lVAuy8,356.639,3.68,were to go back and binge at all i mean
k5S62lVAuy8,358.72,3.919,maybe my enjoyment for that first season
k5S62lVAuy8,360.319,3.921,would increase more but i had a lot of
k5S62lVAuy8,362.639,3.601,fun with the second season the
k5S62lVAuy8,364.24,4.399,storytelling felt richer to me as well
k5S62lVAuy8,366.24,4.56,as more cohesive and i loved watching
k5S62lVAuy8,368.639,4.241,the political drama play out and all of
k5S62lVAuy8,370.8,4.56,the scheming and posturing that's taking
k5S62lVAuy8,372.88,4.56,place it feels real in some senses which
k5S62lVAuy8,375.36,3.679,is then kind of scary but i think truly
k5S62lVAuy8,377.44,3.92,what made this season for me is the
k5S62lVAuy8,379.039,4.481,drama and the mystery surrounding siri
k5S62lVAuy8,381.36,4.64,her relationship with geralt is powerful
k5S62lVAuy8,383.52,4.239,and very engaging and also relatable in
k5S62lVAuy8,386.0,3.919,certain aspects the growth they both
k5S62lVAuy8,387.759,3.681,exhibit is hard not to be invested in
k5S62lVAuy8,389.919,3.921,and then make them characters that you
k5S62lVAuy8,391.44,4.08,want to see succeed even when it looks
k5S62lVAuy8,393.84,4.079,like things may not be headed in the
k5S62lVAuy8,395.52,4.399,most positive of directions i'm so glad
k5S62lVAuy8,397.919,4.161,we get to see more of geralt and him in
k5S62lVAuy8,399.919,4.56,his element with the other witchers too
k5S62lVAuy8,402.08,4.8,that camaraderie is humorous but then
k5S62lVAuy8,404.479,4.56,also it works to feed into his dynamic
k5S62lVAuy8,406.88,4.24,with siri and their progression and for
k5S62lVAuy8,409.039,4.321,me watching him drink the potion and be
k5S62lVAuy8,411.12,4.4,able to see the transformation in his
k5S62lVAuy8,413.36,4.32,face and his eyes and that's a great
k5S62lVAuy8,415.52,4.32,effect and i loved it because then i
k5S62lVAuy8,417.68,3.76,knew something awesome was just about to
k5S62lVAuy8,419.84,3.199,happen i'm excited to see how this
k5S62lVAuy8,421.44,4.08,season wraps up and it feels like we're
k5S62lVAuy8,423.039,5.121,headed to an awesome climax just full of
k5S62lVAuy8,425.52,4.399,peril and probably a massive battle the
k5S62lVAuy8,428.16,3.52,world feels on the brink of something
k5S62lVAuy8,429.919,4.081,huge like it's reaching this breaking
k5S62lVAuy8,431.68,4.959,point and when that time comes it'll be
k5S62lVAuy8,434.0,5.039,explosive and exciting there's sex
k5S62lVAuy8,436.639,4.161,nudity a ton of profanity and a massive
k5S62lVAuy8,439.039,3.6,amount of violence now i'm not going to
k5S62lVAuy8,440.8,3.44,give a firm score on this season because
k5S62lVAuy8,442.639,3.28,there are two episodes left that i
k5S62lVAuy8,444.24,3.04,haven't seen and while i don't think
k5S62lVAuy8,445.919,3.441,it's going to fall off the rails and
k5S62lVAuy8,447.28,4.639,just have the show jump the shark it is
k5S62lVAuy8,449.36,4.8,a possibility but that being said
k5S62lVAuy8,451.919,4.72,preliminarily i give season 2 of the
k5S62lVAuy8,454.16,4.319,witcher 4 out of 5 couches so are you a
