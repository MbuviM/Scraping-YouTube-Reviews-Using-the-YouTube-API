How could have not played the witcher games?<br><br>Jeremy:  have you? played the witcher games?<br><br>Me:  uh, no, I have a life and a girlfriend,  more like a wife.
Where‚Äôs season 2 review?
Crazy hair.
The fighting sequences are awesome
OMMMGGGG
I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs now pronouncing Henry Cavill‚Äôs name right
He never did season 2. Wtf?
What a letdown of a show‚Ä¶
I get confused because I played the games first and Triss in the games looks the complete opposite to Triss in the series... Henry did really well as Geralt, but as someone else said, thus far the monsters are pretty underwhelming, this show is set for 7 series, hopefully it all picks up a bit in the next one, I&#39;m not really amazed as I thought I would be, I was holding off from watching this until the first 3 series were out, but I gave in an have finished the first 2 and I&#39;m not completely satisfied as a huge Witcher fan... I hope this doesn&#39;t fall through.
At one point Yennefer mentioned that &quot;3 decades&quot; had past during her court work.
Season 2 Review. I think it was more exciting than S1, though it was inaccurate to the books. Both seasons were decent in different ways
Review Season 2. Its a really good binge
Bad acting , bad wrighting, The Witcher might have the least effective world-building of any fantasy show in history, a remarkably bland palette that kills any desire to pay attention. cheesy,  shallow and edgy, really looks like watching disney movies. I am really surprise this show entertained me for 3 episodes.
Season 2!!!
The jumping around between 3 timelines absolutely ruined the series.
1/10 geralt doesn&#39;t show a scene playing gwent on netflix after many goddamn episodes later
Season 2 review of The Witcher? I&#39;m curious where you stand with the show. I watched it all the way through this weekend. It felt like a lot more effort with not as much payoff this season. I still liked it enough to still look forward to season 3.
I&#39;m usually not into shows about medieval and magical worlds, but season 1 was pretty damn enthralling and enjoyable. üëç
I&#39;d really recommend playing Wild Hunt really does deserve it&#39;s title of one of the best games of all time up there with BioShock
Yennefer is the star
Just got netflix.. The trailers look badass as fuck!! If it any funny tho are marvel fans gonna like it!?!?
Have to disagree with you cause Henry cavill was the main reason I watched and he did a great job as geralt. Yen was ok but she can be a bitch at times but I did like ciri and jaskier. But Henry cavill was the best part about the show
I hate this series. It was boring
Ok, I don&#39;t get it! The Ciri storyline is great. Maybe to those unfamiliar to the books and games who don&#39;t know the lore don&#39;t understand. The show does jump around and has confusing timelines but ciris story is awesome. Was it disjointed when it switched from daenerys to jon snow in game of thrones? Just pay attention and perhaps look into the lore if you don&#39;t understand. The new anime nightmare of the wolf, I believe it&#39;s called, is great too. I recommend highly if you want more backstory but you don&#39;t own the books. The either is one of the best series of all time imo.
the show is good overall but i wished  they adapted the books more faithfully
Geralt polish feminist from Grove street...
The books are awesome! The show is just as good.
The best performance was Henry Cavill‚Äôs incredible portrayal of Geralt. Yennefer‚Äôs constantly appearing boobs were the best part of her character. Jaskier was corny and over the top but occasionally funny. Everyone else was forgettable as hell.
you should play witcher 3 game
timelines are stupid
You love the Metal Gear, i see. <br>Try the game which beat MGS Phantom pain for the GOTY 2015.<br>Its Awesometacular.
Lol PLAY THE GAME!!
This show is awful. Absolute trash. What a waste of a good copyright license. We probably won&#39;t see another Witcher show/movie for a very long time. It had so much potential. The source material is rich with good lore, good characters and interesting plotlines. A show based on The Witcher could&#39;ve been up there with the best shows ever. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, etc. Instead we get this garbage. It&#39;s like a low budget B title work at best. The people who made it don&#39;t care. They were more interested in pushing a political agenda than making a good show. I wish HBO made it instead of Netflix.
request? there‚Äôs no request for u to review witcher. dafuq
Ik I‚Äôm a year late, but my main pet peeve was how poorly they dealt with the lesser evil from the book, like they didn‚Äôt explain the market place at all. <br><br>If anyone is interested in reading that part(it‚Äôs about 15 pages), you can find a pdf of it on google
The timeline of this show was something I didn‚Äôt even realise was out of order until I just happened to skim down an episode‚Äôs page on the Witcher Wiki looking for some possible trivia.
the story line confused me the whole way through like wtf is the timeline O.o
Jeremy should be forbidden from reviewing season 2 until he plays the game üòÇ there&#39;s Pulp Fiction reference in it for goodness sake! He gotta get on that
Yes brother, we all know Yennefer.
After playing the game, I couldn&#39;t even watch the first season entirely.<br>It was so bad.
&quot;I think leather blocks pitchforks&quot; you have no idea how funny that is in the context of the witcher
I know I‚Äôm late to the party but I‚Äôll throw my two cents in. I haven‚Äôt read the books or played the games so I went in completely blind. Oddly enough, my favourite episode was actually the first. Everything with Yennifer was actually really boring and I think the show would have been better without her. I think the show would have been better off if it was only about Geralt and Ciri. It should have gone for a darker tone overall. It felt like it couldn‚Äôt make up its mind over whether or not it wanted to be a Gothic monster hunting thing or a teenage girl goes to magic school thing or a fantasy adventure. I found all the stuff about different kingdoms and mages and stuff to be really confusing and had a hard time following what was going on. I liked the initial idea of Ciri fleeing from her kingdom and having to find Geralt, and I also like the stuff that Geralt did do, but the whole Yennifer thing threw me off. It would have been better if we had gotten more Geralt and not done Yennifer at all. I also felt like there was a tonality shift about half way through with the first half being dark and gritty and then doing whatever the second half was. I don‚Äôt know. I really liked the first episode and then it just slowly went downhill from there.
wow they really should warn if they are gonna fucking <b>SPOIL!!!</b> üò¨üò†üò†
I also really enjoyed the series but I did find it a bit unnecessarily confusing. I felt as if some elements needed extra episodes to explain them. For instance the final battle with the sorcerers kind of took me a good while to understand who even nilfgard are I just thought it could be a bit random sometimes. But I agree with the characters being the best part in the show
I watched the whole first season,  and it&#39;s a junk.
they made up yennifer&#39;s story line quite a lot.  the stupid baby plot ughhhhh
How dare you talk about this series without playing the game? Pitch forks!!!!!!
I kinda liked ciri‚Äôs arc more than yennefers
At least play wild hunt jeremy
The mage describes a solar eclipse as a curse in the first episode... some say a very big one should happen again in the very near future, causing around 5 days with no sun and electricity.
Il give it a 5/10 has so muck potential but they dident use it !!! IDIOTS
Ur the worst reviewer
Damn you guys must be smoking some good as reggie, because there is no way in fkn hell anyone sober would like this dogshit show. Damnnnn Jeremy I&#39;m sorry man you been spot on with 95% of your reviews IMO, but this one nop. Cant agreed with you. Show is DOGSHIT
Fam I found a video before the end time
the worst series on Netflix, no doubt
The funniest thing was the dragon can speak with his mouth shut ü§£üò≥üò≥
Just so you know with very mild spoiler here. No matter how they try todo it season 2 will be all about ciri and what the the wild hunt is and less about Yennifer. There&#39;s just no way of getting around it. I say what the wild hunt is bc I seriously doubt they&#39;ll make it that far to see it based in the first season
series was good for newbies but as an adaptation it sucked balls<br>A lot of good shit was cut out and anyone who read the books will know that it would have a lot better to include ven the minor details
Just hope they won‚Äôt go with the bad ending
Just play the game mannn
I hated this show. Not a single episode showed Geralt helping some1 find their frying pan 1/10 is my final score.
Make a review of Queen&#39;s gambit
Either the author of the Witcher saw (or read) Claymore, or the author of Claymore read the Witcher...I‚Äôm not sure which one was made first.
The blackwashing is rather distracting and unnecessary (despite what twitter wants people to believe) but I don&#39;t want to shit on the black actors. They all did alright. Miscasted.. but alright.
Its even more confusing for people who don&#39;t know that these characters don&#39;t age very quickly. So an episode could be years ahead and the audience would think it&#39;s next week.
Okay, hasn&#39;t played the games...yet? Hahaha. Come on Jeremy,  play the games. Heck just play the 3rd one at this point mat.(Not to say all three aren&#39;t great for their own reasons.) I know it&#39;s the month of the spooky reviews right now BUT...it&#39;s still the pandemic, get on that Witcher 3 action man.
If you can&#39;t get to sleep and don&#39;t have any sleeping pills then put an episode of this show on and you will be sleeping within five minutes.
So you can&#39;t make good Video Game movies, but you CAN make a good Video Game shows?<br><br><b>Nice.</b>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m59s"">0:59</a> don‚Äôt worry I haven‚Äôt either (I really want to) I am reading the books though.
I would LOVE for you to talk about HBO and BBC&#39;s His Dark Materials.
Review YOU(Netflix original series)
Do Sherlock series 3 and 4....also The Umbrella Academy
I think the show is off to a really good start, I just hope season 2 isn‚Äôt as convoluted in its story telling, and here and there (especially in the first few episodes) the acting seemed a little overplayed, but other than that, it‚Äôs a solid 7/10 start. Also I really urge you to play the games, especially 3.
Why, in the love of all things holy and unholy, have you not played Witcher 3?
I don&#39;t think yennifer or her story in this series was good at all. It&#39;s basically she pursued power and beauty, got it then the rest of the series she complains that they took her choice away from her. Even though right before she did it they did say, this stuffs going to ruin these specific things are you sure? And she said yeah.
I just watched The Witcher yesterday and two episodes later, I still don&#39;t understand what the story is about and who the characters are supposed to be. I&#39;ve never played the game, but I see my brother play the game almost everyday. And I definitely didn&#39;t read the books.<br><br>Were the writers writing it for the game/book fans only? What&#39;s the point of making the show then?<br><br>I&#39;ve never read LOTR or GOT before the show, but it didn&#39;t take me more than 2 hours to understand what the stories are.<br><br>Personally, I think the show is just really badly written and wouldn&#39;t appeal to a newer audience like myself.
Ciri will grow on you as they start adapting the novels. Right now it‚Äôs just the short stories they‚Äôre adapting. If they pull it off she‚Äôll be cooler than Arya in GOT.
The Witcher 3is the best game I‚Äôve ever played
Best line for Geralt, &quot; hmmm, Fuck&quot; üòÜ
Yeah the passage of time is confusing...if you don&#39;t realize two of the main characters don&#39;t age like normal people.
I feel like this series has brought back a bit of the humour and feeling of the Xena and Hercules series of the 90&#39;s, but without the campiness and more budget. <br>It&#39;s something I&#39;ve really missed in all these more serious series focused on bigger events. <br>And Anya Chalotra really steals the show, she&#39;s amazing and really seems like a talented young actress who will be going places especially when you see how different she is in interviews. <br>She&#39;s a complex character with plenty of flaws but also can be pretty badass. <br>Overall I really love how the show gives us these badass women through the series, but let them be flawed. Like how this warrior Queen initially seems pretty cool and badass but turns out to be a pretty shitty person. <br>And that&#39;s whats often the problem in some recent media, badass women who are too flawless, too perfect. <br>It&#39;s the flaws that make us human. <br><br>Henry Cavil does an amazing job as Geralt too. He&#39;s believable as this veteran monster slayer without having to say a word. He has this presence to him. And he has kindness too behind the rough exterior. Also makes mistakes.
You didn&#39;t play the witcher series? Jeremy....wtf dude lol
Henry melts me from the inside with his sexiness ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI died watching
It&#39;s too much like Game of Thrones with hardly any action scenes and a butchered story. It&#39;s a fantasy soap opera. At least the limited amount of fight scenes in GoT were good.
Felt less like Game of Thrones and more like Rated R Hercules; The Legendary Journeys.....with better graphics.
This show was terrible wtf Jeremy
He needs to play Witcher 3 to see the hype that is Ciri.
Yennefer is indian, big part of the characters are black....<br>Very fckin well done !<br>Why they didn&#39;t bring gay and lesbians too !! Smh
hateful comment
38 special
They fucked this series
Didn&#39;t read the books nor played the games. I do love fantasy but I went to Witcher as a complete normie. I really enjoyed it
A blind review.... of a game / TV show that&#39;s been around... probably since your birth... come on, man (._. )
This show is not perfect but I fucking loved it
I‚Äôm not mad you haven‚Äôt played the Witcher 3 just sad that you‚Äôre missing out on something awesome.
God I love Jeremy, he pointed out the flaws and liked it and also praised it... Unlike critics whoch give it a zero because they couldnt figure out that storylines aren&#39;t in the same timeline
I agree with the time jump thing, but Henry Cavill crushed it. I loved it!
Jeremy, love you and these reviews dude. But WHY have you not reviewed LOST?! I saw how much you enjoy Fringe, and I truly believe you would enjoy a TON of stuff in LOST.
played the 1st game, got the what i think was the 1st town (its been years) and stopped playing, just wasnt interesting.<br>tried the 3rd game, and instantly hated the wonky controls, and how unresponsive it was. by the time i left the tutorial area, and could actually run around, i lost interest, so i ran into the woods, to just head to the edge of the map, and the terrible controls just ruined any fun i could have, and just turned the game off, and havent touched it since.<br>while i usually go with a 3 strike rule, in this case, i felt 2 strikes was enough. ive debated if i wanted to give the show a chance, but this didnt quite sound convincing enough, but maybe its to avoid spoilers, so idk.
I really liked, yes, Jennifer it&#39;s the best.<br>About the first episode, someone who&#39;s into the books mentioned in other video that they cut a lot of the story to make it fit in one episode, with the rest of the story the first episode makes more sense.<br><br>Looking forward for season 2.
I guess I am the one who dislike the series?
jeremy was defintely a mimicrist before. he does great mimcry of characters
triss&#39;s hair needs to be red asap
Watching through a few of your videos i see myself agree with so many things youre saying. Its actually quite amazing. <br><br>The passage of time fucked me up and i was completely confused so many times. I couldnt give less of a fuck about siri and i wanted the story to be with yennefer or geralt.
The games are based on books, but its more of continuation not adaptation. The 1st season is adaptation of first two books. Read them, you will realize how messed up this show is.<br>You dont know much about witchers, because the screenwriters totally ignored worldbuilding.<br>Entire Yennefers storyline is made up, illogical, it breaks the lore and it has nothing to do with main story. <br>Ciris storyline is based on like two-three sentences in book. Its just boring and uninteresting.<br>Geralts storylines are based on short stories from books, but they are so messed up, you feel like writers didnt even care. The main plot of the show is Geralt and Ciri, hence only 3 short stories are really important for storytelling, they didnt even adapt one.<br>The show had $70-80 million budget, its comparable with Game of Thrones, it still looks like Xena or Hercules.<br>You liked it because the general opinion is that its good. People think its good of games, because of Cavill, because the the base of the story is good (kept from books) and because its a new Witcher story. People didnt read the books, they dont realize how messed up the story, the characters and entire Witcher world is. I was hearthbroken, it could have been sooo so so much better.
PLAY THE WITCHEEEEEEEEER GAMEEEEEES
One other thing I&#39;ll add I felt really bad for Gerald, Ciri and Yen the entire time also all of them felt very complicated and human which was a very unusual thing to see since that doesn&#39;t happen often in a fantasy series often. Got to hand it to the writers and producers they did a brilliant job with it. Only nit pick a got a little dizzy from all the blood and gore but that&#39;s on me LOL.
I watched the Witcher before I read the books or played the games, am considering in trying out the games since was an entertaining story and am looking forward to season 2. By the way any clue when season 2 is out?
does this dude not realize there were multiple timelines?
Aww poor Ciri, I thoroughly enjoyed her storyline. I felt the desperation of her trying to find Geralt and Geralt trying to find her. When they met in the woods, it was such a great moment.
So I get angry in every episode because of how much they change things that should not been changed, characters and places even moment&#39;s have been removed or rearenged in way&#39;s that make&#39;s no sence.<br>1 of these moments are Ciri&#39;s adventure in Brokalon, it happend when she was 6 years old, and it was the first time she meet Gerald with out even knowing that he was the Witcher she was promised to.<br>If Gerald had not been there the Drieds whould have killed her on the spot, it was only because Gerald the White Wolf where there that she survived.<br>another moment that made no sence was the adventure with the Devil, Dendilion and Gerald had been friends for years already at that moment, and whats more when his lute was broken Gerald got angry thats why he hit the elf women in the face, oh and might I mention the fact that THEY GOT SAVED BY THE GODESS OF HARVEST, yes a Godess or the avatar for one saved them, the man who hired Gerald came from a village and Gerald staid there for a couple of day&#39;s whats more the Devil was kind hearted when he first meet the Witcher they talked, the only reson he began trowing rocks was because Dendilion keept making joke&#39;s that whent over the devils head and when Gerald told him to stop with the joking the Devil got offended, it was not untill the second incounter that he and Gerald began to fight and it was only a game a game Gerald call &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t do to Others what you don&#39;t want don to you&#39;&#39; then the elf&#39;s attacked.<br>I want to add I&#39;m on Episode 5 and is a bit worried over how the rest of the episode&#39;s will be adaptation wise.
If you don&#39;t know the books and the game just shut the fuck up... a black guy at the court, I&#39;m not racist but Witcher is a Slavic story. In their time he would he hanged on a tree.
The show was alright... not much into witcher but it was good
Of course you were to fall in love with Yennefer... the show slapped her in ur face every chance it could. Might as well be called the sorceress instead.
You didn‚Äôt toss a coin for The Witcher! How dare you Jeremy! For shame!
Ngl sometimes this show felt like the Yennefer show feat. Henry Cavill as the Witcher, still a kick ass show tho
Yea took me a couples episodes too
Come on, you piece of filth!<br><br>Play the damn game. You have the time
I know this can be nit picky but I don&#39;t like the portrayal of henry cavill as geralt. He just seems a bit too GQ pretty boy type. Not that Geralt should be ugly, its just that his good looks are based on having a rugged appearance, tathered and scared. LIke the guy that played in valhalla rising. Its true of any book though really.
I&#39;m going to pretend that Geralt of Rivia is the son of Daenerys Targaryen (my queen) and Jon Snow aka Aegon Targaryen
What confused me the most was that they started the Siri character building at the same time as Yennifer and Big buff dude, and then at some point in the middle of the series his story was at a point before Siri was even born, but it was still correct for his specific storyline.  So the entire show leading up to that point I thought that these stories are happening in parallel, but they weren&#39;t at all.
Pretty mediocre. First episode was the only one I enjoyed.
i was expecting superman to be the worst part of the show ....and,after watching the show, it turns out he was the best part
no mention of the song.. Toss a coin to your witcher.. no? It&#39;s so good I just can&#39;t get it out of my head since I saw this show!!! great show and I haven&#39;t played the games either... I love Cavil and the Geralt character and actually the time passage is one of the things that got me into this, it made me think and connect this things that were happening through little hints instead of laying it out in my face.. I dig that.
Go play the wither games
In regards to the timeline. The show actually followed the books very much spot on in that regard. <br><br>The books jump around in time a lot and there‚Äôs no hint of how much time has passed outside of the reader having to pick it up through the dialogue.
I found the witcher to be utter horse shit<br>It started off AMAZING, the bug battles were a great and amazing entree full of brutal violence and a badass queen who wanted to fuck shit up.<br>But then not too long after, i binged the season in a night, jaskier is fucking annoying, yennefer is a self absorbed popularity complex bitch, ciri and... ciris mother? Pavwhatever... i honestly thought they were the same character because all they fucking do is SCREAM! Ciris/ciris mothers script for more than half the series was just an ear pitching scream!<br>And now the world of the witcher is huge, but if it feels so small and compact, and all you hear is DESTINY.<br>DESTINY, DESTINY, DESTINY, BULLSHIT PLOT DEVICE, DESTINY!<br>I am so let down with this series<br>Its obvious that the ENTIRE budget went on henry cavill because his character was the most honourable to the interpretation.
The end battle and the entire final episode was pretty dissapointing, they were playing out the deaths really <br>dramatically and couldn&#39;t care less. I enyoy the firts season but it needs some mayor improvements for season 2
M y only 2 problem with the show were:<br>1- poor dialogues it felt so cut and short and shallow <br>2- not enough exposition in the show like , I watched GOT before reading the novels, but they did great job in season one explaining everything during kings travels with ned or his war stories with his bodyguards or the side talks here and there that gave me full perspective on the show . But here if you never played the game or read the books you‚Äôd be so confused.
The story in the games was way more better and much more coherent
The Witcher 2 and 3 are only two of the top ten games ever. Never played 1. Greatest soundtracks in video game history. Bro you have to check them out. Come on man
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather blocks pitchforks‚Äù <br><br>Geralt:‚Äùit doesn‚Äôt‚Äù
A lot of people are complaining about how there is no backstory and the story is shabby.<br><br>The reason for this is because Season 1 or the first book is essentially the backstory. It introduces the main characters, how they met, and sets up the plot for when the actual story begins. So I&#39;d expect Season 2 to be a lot more structured, easier to follow and have a badass story for you people to hype over. Seriously the story is so good.<br><br><br>While you&#39;re all probably thinking that it&#39;s a mess and makes no sense, you&#39;ll be grateful for it later down the line, I promise you that. Where he says that Geralt and Yen are in the party and Ciri is away from the party, I would put it differently. It&#39;s more like Geralt and Yen are having pre-drinks while Ciri is getting ready for the party. Season 2 is where the party actually starts.
No...Apple&#39;s ai Siri...like the character Ciri
I‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts on the game some time ..... it makes the show better I think
Well at least I saw why Geralt is called &quot;the butcher of blaviken&quot;
I feel like that doppler from Ep.6 disguise himself as Dara<br>Just sayin as a theory!!
I liked it a lot tbh. Can&#39;t wait for Season 2.
Fringilla ruins the plots later on, where in the later parts of the books geralt sometimes mistake her for yennifer because of their looks after they grow into an intimate relationship. Also fringilla is suppose to be the cousin of Anna, but now they won&#39;t have similar looks. Also society in the witcher is presented to criticize every race, elves, soceresses/witchs, witchers. No offence but her ethnicity conflicts with some of the later plots as the humans can&#39;t deal with people who are different in the witcher, so it kind of ruins the theme of humans fearing the people who are different are portrayed as outcasts. If they wanted a black actress, they should&#39;ve made a new character to emphasize the theme of being different instead they took a risk and ruined later plots.
It feels as though people who haven&#39;t read the books like this show more than people that have, myself being the latter.
&quot;Yennifer&quot; the most lazy name creation in all of fantasy.
I&#39;m surprised you liked this show because it&#39;s so terrible. <br><br>I mean almost everything there was great: the acting, cinematography, color grading, music, CGI...Except the writing, which was horrible and ruined everything. Nothing makes much sense. So many characters were introduced but you care for none of them because there was no real development. Every episode looks fragmented and seems like they just wanna fill the hours. The ending and every chapter feels anticlimactic. This makes me think Henry Cavil signed a contract stipulating how many days he could be on the set so they tried their best to utilize him...making us feel like he was there as the main character though he really wasn&#39;t. Oh forgot to mention, he was just there with the same facial expressions, speaking with a husky tone of voice the whole time. <br><br>I&#39;m not looking forward to season 2, unless they hire a whole net set of screen writers. Seriously, Carnival Row was a lot better, even though it kind of looked cheaper than this series.
I played The Witcher 3 (not 1 and 2) and also read the short stories, but not yet the novels. So far, I thought the show was a good blend between the novels&#39; and the games&#39; styles, coming off the first episode. I&#39;ve also just seen the first episode of The Mandalorian, because Disney Plus has just been released in my country. Both are actually very similar: a lone mercenary-esque fighter, who gets tangled into messy things and proves to have a heart of gold... more or less. However, in The Witcher, the whole Ciri plotline felt like complete filler (I know from where the story is going, that it isn&#39;t) and the story always stepped hard on the brakes, especially, since it&#39;s the typical bloody battle and gruesome fate stuff we&#39;ve all seen so many times just better and when we were much more invested in the characters. Meanwhile, The Mandalorian was happy to have an episode at 36 minutes runtime, focused entirely on the story it wanted to tell, with no distractions. <br>So far, I&#39;m curious for both shows, but The Mandalorian is the clear winner in the storytelling department, even though The Witcher does have more potential with it&#39;s grey morality. The short story the first episode was based on was really great, with Gerald taking out thieves and murderers, but not being hailed as a hero, but seen as an even bigger monster by the people of the town. <br><br>The one thing that is missing most to me in The Witcher which both the games and the short stories had, is it&#39;s dark humor. The stories and the game&#39;s scenarios could often be genuinely funny, even hilarious, while also retaining it&#39;s tragic and grimness. So far, the show is just grim and drab. However, let me know if that gets better a few episodes in.
Love the game! Its good to play The Witcher 3 at least to understand a lot of the characters and the language they use. My favorite character had to be The witcher and Dandelion. Even in the games, the chemistry is amazing!
There is one serious problem with this series: time line
I honestly HATED Yennefer, she was the worst part of the show for me. They try and portray her as like this tragic, emotional and cunning character but she just comes off as angsty and immature.
episode 3 was the best episode of season  1
I loved the witcher. The timeline was only slightly confusing but once I realized that they were on different timelines (basically when yen said that she had been working in court for decades and when Jaskier brought geralt to the queens party) it actually brought me excitement. I was excited to see where the timelines would meet up and how. But that&#39;s just me. I&#39;m definitely ready for season 2
Woke casting ruined it for me
Yennifer&#39;s story was decent, but the actress who played her was really hard to look at, and I&#39;m talking after her transformation into &quot;hotness&quot;
Was so funny the party reference you did, literally laughed for abit üëèüèª
Hey !! ...... I haven‚Äôt played the Witcher either
Should of been called the &quot;Cheez-WHIZard&quot; instead of Witcher. It&#39;s alot more Xena princess warrior and a lot less game of  thrones . Only an asshole would think this is good
&quot;who is Yennefer?&quot;
Too many white people in polish mythology for me... typical white supremacy.
Very basic timeline explanation.<br><br>Ciri&#39;s story is present day. Takes place in a couple of weeks.<br><br>Yennifer we get a origin story taking place decades before Ciri&#39;s story and then there is a several decades long time jump to when she escapes the assassin. After that, her story is more in line with where we first saw Geralt.<br><br>Geralt&#39;s story starts years before Ciri was born and jumps years from episode to episode. <br><br>Episode 7-8 for Geralt and Yennifer take place during the same timespan as Ciri&#39;s story. When the battle begins is the first time where all three main characters stories takes place during the same timeframe<br><br>Ciri&#39;s story is a couple weeks.<br>Yennifer&#39;s story spans 80ish years.<br>Geralt&#39;s story spans 20 years or so, I&#39;m unsure how long ago Blaviken was by the time of Ciri&#39;s parents marriage (15years befoe the start of Ciri&#39;s story in episode 1). Though Geralt&#39;s flashback in ep.8 goes back 80 years or so. Yep, he is old as shit too.
My wife&#39;s favorite character was the bard...
You‚Äôre very clever and original. Nice job.
All i have to say is &quot;not bad&quot;. they should focus on geralt more on season 2 or rename the series to &quot;yennefer the witch&quot; or any suitable name :D
henry cavill was so damn good in this.
In season 2 I want 10x more mmms and fucks<br>Make it so
I ONLY UNDERSTAND THE TIMELINE BY 7TH EP.
1st review I came across is from someone who is not familiar. Ok. Season 1 ep 2. The Devil story was a short story from the books. Devil was pronounced Dee-ovil by the locals which set a funny kinda tone, folk tale vibe... For me it was one of the best short stories from the &#39;1st&#39; Book, The Witcher: The Last Wish. This series absoutley destroyed it! Dandilion received his Legendary Lute in this story... now watch the series with that little bit of info. It&#39;s absurd that this series was approved.
I never really got the hook. I thought this show was very boring but I wanted it to be more I feel like we only saw Garalt fight a few times there was so much talking and the whole weird time thing that happens with Garalt and Ciri through me a loop too
Theyre mutated at birth and thats how they get their powers .. They kill beasts and apparitions and things along those lines by trade, its worth noting that they dont feel emotions like anger or sadness
Play the games man.
What I&#39;ll say about Yennefer is that I enjoyed her story line, but I wanted more of Garalt.
if you have beauty and power and you&#39;re not happy I hate you, you suck. and nothing will ever be good enough for you, period
Why should we be angry that you&#39;ve never pleayed OR read, we&#39;re just a bit jealous that you can experience it for the first time and we can&#39;t have that first time again :D
get the pitchforks
Critics dislike this show, but fans loved it. Just like Rise of Skywalker.
YES! Yennefer is the best character, love her so much!
I loved the Bard. Lore bard! Absolutely. But what&#39;s the Witcher? Eldritch Knight?
For me, Henry Cavill sells and carries this show. His love for the books and the games and his enthusiasm about playing Geralt really shine through. Of course it also helps that he is a total snack ;-)<br>The whole first season feels like they were kind of testing the waters... now that it&#39;s a huge success, I hope they really get into it. The show has massive potential, I hope they give it a fair chance to shine!
HI Mate Just to ask you watched the first two episodes very dark scenery ie you just about see the people is it mean to be like that. Cheers
It also took me a while to realize that <b>not really a spoiler but does reveal a little bit about the show</b> they were kinda doing the whole &quot;Westworld&quot; thing where they jump between timelines without any real indication beyond context clues in the background or the occasional throwaway line. Once I realized what they were doing, I enjoyed the experience a lot more. I just wasn&#39;t expecting it at first.
I mean given Henry was just superstach yeaa it would take a couple episodes to get attached to characters
your super sexy btw. I wished I could watch the show with you, i think I would die laughing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The entire season is the backstory !
The Witcher will get better but let&#39;s not pretend this was a good start. Come on Lucifer dont pander to Witcher fans!
Not only did Henry take the role he actively persude the role. He called the casting director so much that when it came time to cast Geralt she thought of Henry first. Or, that&#39;s the story.
Can&#39;t wait for season 2. The cast does an incredible job.
That&#39;s a sin to never at least tried the witcher 3
Just watched the Witcher a little while ago and thought it was an amazing Netflix show!!! Can‚Äôt wait for season 2
this show should named (how Superman would looks like if he got Batman voice) Henry didn‚Äôt fit the character , his ass was so big for the leather trousers , and he kept the same fucking face all the freaking show
The reason there‚Äôs so many time skips in the first season is because the book it‚Äôs based on is short stories through their lives ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who doesn‚Äôt follow the story at all.
bad series
Im still confused about the appearance of a tiny golden dragon during geralt&#39;s childhood. But anyhow, the main theme of the first season is destiny , and the last few episodes showed the repercussions of messing with such things
And where&#39;s the rating?
And where&#39;s the rating?
Geralt could tell you whether or not leather protects you from pitchforks.
GO PLAY THEM
Haven&#39;t played the games, haven&#39;t read the books, just thought I watch a nice show... there is no world-building in this show. I&#39;ve seen 8 episodes and still don&#39;t know what a Witcher is exactly and why they were created, not even talking about the factions involved, what they really want, and why they are hunting Ciri. I picked up on the two timelines pretty fast, and I thought passage of time was poorly done... maybe they should&#39;ve done more than 8 episodes. I loved Yennifer, however the best part of her story was not shown, the realization, that beauty and power cannot make her happy. From a story-telling point of view the series is a disaster, I down-rated it on Netflix, and I&#39;m not even interested in season 2. Did they use D&amp;D and Rian Johnson to write this, or are there even more shitty writers out there, that I haven&#39;t even heard of? <br><br><br>So sorry for the actors. They did a great job with what they were given. I hope they get better jobs in the future.
Play the games!   But thanks for review.
I didn&#39;t really like the game but I enjoyed the series
I feel like this whole season was a prologue. Like it hasn‚Äôt even really started yet.
I wanted to really like this show but the acting as bad , the plot confusing. Why all the time skips ? Not really a lot of fighting monsters , at least I would have wanted  more . Special effects were terrible. Like watching xena warrior princess
on all people who which i talk about this show, we all agre that the show is &quot;mmmmmokay&quot; on ep 1 and 2 and &quot;GREAT!&quot; starting at the 3rd episode
I really liked the series flawed yes horrendously entertaining yes would watch again definitely.
the witcher series reminds me of the original game, considering the very intro of the original game is in this series. What you explained about Yennefer is why The Witcher games are epic, those types of human self questions are riddled ALL through the games.
OMG!  You have not played Witcher 3, the game that some think is one of the greatest games ever made?  LOL!<br>Great Review.  You convinced me to give this a try.  Thank you for reviewing and giving your opinion.  Great Job!!!
Mmmmm... fuck.
Chilling adventures of sabrina?
Lighthouse review please!
Did u... did u... u didn‚Äôt mention ‚Äûtoss a coin to your witcher‚Äù?
just play game mate  skip 1 game  play 2 and  3  the best movie expirience you ever played ;)
Dude you&#39;re missing out! Go to best buy and buy it! Order it on Amazon, on Playstation Store! Promise you won&#39;t regret it.
I played Witcher 3 for the first time after seeing the show. The game for me was much like the show in that it took me a while to get the feel and really appreciate what was accomplished here.
I have been watching your reviews for years and I only just realized how beautiful your hair is ... :D
Love this review!
I still have no idea how yeneffer went from a rookie witch to a badass godlike witch. Had that one dude not said ‚Äúits been 10 years‚Äù i would still have no idea wtf happened on that show. Time travel/time passage shit was absolutly terrible and it almost kills the entire thing for me. I never knee what point in time any of the characters were in the show.
It‚Äôs alright man, I watched the series before the game, and GOD I LOVE THE GAME
i haven&#39;t played the video game either. i am deathly allergic to AAA games as it is.
listen, Jeremy, I&#39;m not mad, I&#39;m just disappointed. For your own good brother PLAY THE WITHCER
Watch naruto
Probably would be worth to mention that both, the series and game are based on the books of Andrzej Sapkowski. Polish write who actually created whole story.
No mention of the first episode sword fight one shot amazingness?! That scene is the best part of the whole season in my opinion which is fortunate and unfortunate.
Gotta say while the show is alright I still prefer the first few books
Yeah lol... the show called The Witcher isn&#39;t actually about the Witcher but about Yennifer lol.... spoiler. Oh and woke as hell of course.
The Ciri/Siri analogy about not being in the party is so spot on lol. Probably my least favorite thing in the show. I didn‚Äôt mind the lower budget CGI monsters and even some of the sets.  Makes sense that they put out some feelers first. If others liked it as much as I did, season 2s budget will significantly up the anti. How the show came back together w/ the storming of Cintra was so dope.
Dracula next?
Hi Jeremy,<br><br>Please review Supernatural series as a whole. I wanna know your thoughts on it.
I like this world more than game of thrones there&#39;s actual consequences to actions unlike game of thrones where it&#39;s a coin flip on with actions have any ramifications.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èu need to play Witcher 3
I watched the show and loved it and now I&#39;m reading the books and will play the games after and I&#39;m glad the show introduced me to all of this stuff.
He talks like the guy in the game lmao
Wtf!!!!!!YOU HAVEN&#39;T PLAYED THE WITCHER????  Same.
Why doesn&#39;t the bard age? I understand Geralt, Yennifer and Tris cause magic but bard boy? Any clarity on this witcher experts?
&quot;Hmmmmmm fuckkk&quot; - Geralt of Revia
I honestly don‚Äôt like this series that much. It‚Äôs just boring and disappointing. CD projekt red &gt; Netflix.
The Witcher Season 1 was.....fine.
Unwatchable
Nobody is going to talk about how women in armor somehow fighting men twice there size? nobody? okay 2020!
We all know of Yennefer<br>We know watchu meanüòâ
I liked the timeline thing. After watching GoT I was prepared for some story telling trickery and I had fun putting the pieces together. I like that it doesn&#39;t feel the need to spoon feed the audience.
Decent at times. Looks good in comparison to GOT S8. Could be a lot better.
Fan of the books and game (only played Witcher 3), and am absolutely over the moon at how season 1 turned out!! But I wholeheartedly that I hope they do better with how they depict the passage of time, other than that no qualms!
Jeremy play the Witcher 3. Know ur a busy guy but if u do get a lil free time try it out. Really good dialogue for a videos game.
I agree with you on Ciri: she was sort of waiting in the wings during season 1. I can‚Äôt wait for her character to step up and become who she is meant to be.
Blocking...pitchforks...that cut me deep.
Can you please review The untamed Chines drama, its seriously amazing the best i watched
Ended loving the games cos of the series
PLAY THE WITCHER GAME! GET GOING üòâ
My only problem with the Jennifer story is that she is acting like she had no choice in what happened, she knew fully well she would not be able to bare children after the surgery, yet she went through it, and then during the Dragon episode she just whines and is angry about how they took her choice? Just seemed like a very odd, unintellectual and off character moment, and her entire misery now being revolved around that very flawed reasoning made it just cringe
I did not enjoy the show in the slightest.  It was boring, poorly edited, and the CGI was pretty bad.  Henry was great and that‚Äôs about the only thing worth watching.
Yennefer was the best part of the show tbh...
Maybe my expectations were set too high since I&#39;ve played the game for over 200 hours and thought it was a masterpiece, but I&#39;d give this show a 6.5 out of 10. Yes, Geralt and Yennefer were great, but that&#39;s it. I found the rest of the character&#39;s storylines to be dreadfully boring. CGI was terrible and pretty cringe at times, monster fights are incredibly underwhelming. The only choreography done very well was Geralt vs humans, which we only got to see in the first episode. The show should&#39;ve put more focus on the things that were actually entertaining. In the last episode, Geralt was in maybe 10% of the episode. Kinda disappointing, still gonna watch season 2 with high hopes.
Dude, Jaskier ? You missed that.. toss a coin to your witcher ? ...the funny silly musician dude with Geralt
Toss a coin to your witcher.
I loved The Witcher already need season 2. Surprised you didn‚Äôt mention Jaskier. His relationship with Geralt was a good one!
TBH the humour is what really grabbed me - was a nice contrast to all the portentous destiny stuff. Especially all Jaskier/Geralt stuff (can&#39;t believe Jeremy didn&#39;t mention him)
Play The Witcher 3, but play it on the most powerful device you possibly can. Also, invest in Alchemy (thank me later).
Unpopular opinion but I thought the dialogue was often cringy and the writing messy, really didn&#39;t feel much for any of the characters because stuff was happening so fast and with little consequences. The CGI dragons killed it for me, are we in the 90s?
YOU HAVEN&#39;T PLAYED THE WITCHER YET !!!
I&#39;ll make you go blind lol
whats the problem with yennifers story? i havent seen the real criticisms on it but she made the show for me as well
Absolutely, this is a good show, but no fuck%!ng way this is better that Game of Thrones in any aspect.
every single thing you expressed in this review I felt
The first EP was so bad I couldn&#39;t finish it.  About the same reaction I had to the game as well which on the PC felt like console game.
I wish Therica Wilson-Read was Yen or older Ciri. Shes such a looker!
‚ÄúHmmm‚Äù
Witcher Season 1 ... eh.
don&#39;t worry jeremy. I never play the games either. you aren&#39;t alone. going to buy it now though. good thing it is on the switch
No love for Jaskier? C&#39;mon man!
This show is so refreshingly fun and off the chain. Going to go as far as to say The Witcher makes The Mandalorian irrelevant.
As an fan of the books (ooooOoh uppity pretentious fan)...<br><br>This show was still a lot of fun!! I thought it was faithful where is was meant to be and different where it mattered. Ciri‚Äôs story in season 1 was very weak, and interestingly not based on any book. Hopefully that doesn‚Äôt mean that creating new plots will be where the show fails a little bit!<br><br>Glad you tossed a coin it‚Äôs way Jeremy x
Witcher never meant to be the next Game of Thrones.<br>They want the show which would stand of it&#39;s own.<br>That&#39;s what the show is and what was said from the creators.<br>The voices of next GoT are commming from the audience.<br>Some of them are dissapointed, but they wanted something, that never ment to be.<br>So enjoy the show as it is.
Read. The. Book. Play. The. Games.
I feel like if you played the games you really enjoy how Henry Cavill plays Geralt a lot more
I am going to give this series another try just because of this.
The comment about the passage of time is almost exactly how the first book was written, not event per event but close enough stylistically anyway. And yes it was fucking confusing then as well.<br><br><br>The other books are more traditional story though telling though.
Personally, I couldn&#39;t stand Yennifer.
Why is the elf a black dude when they are a white species.<br>just fuck off
To be fair most people haven&#39;t played the Witcher &quot;games&quot;. The majority have played <b>A Witcher game</b><br><br>Then again Witcher 2&#39;s story is meh and Witcher 1 gameplay is a nightmare if you&#39;re used to modern gameplay.
Great review.
I just hope that season 2 won&#39;t have any more of this simultaneous timelines bullshit.
I really liked the passage of time stuff, it was confusing at first but it keep me entertained lol
Just one advice, if you are going to play the games, play them all. Tw1 and then TW2 and then TW3. To play just the 3 game is to lose the soul of TW3 from start...
Meh. Boring writing, acting capablity of a wet towel, convoluded plot. Annoying AF characters. Really disappointed with this.
That scene when the Witcher and Dandelion first meet Yen! Yes! That&#39;s Dandelion! Not whatever that other name is!
Never read the book or played the game but loved the show. I think episode 6 was my least favourite and my favourite part of witcher was Henry Cavill
Siri doing her own thing was a big part of the witcher iii. Havent played the other games or read the books.
ive played witcher 3, read some of the books and watched most of the show and i love it all
The pitchfork comment is either the greatest meta-joke ever made or one hell of a coincidence.
Got pissed that you havent played witcher 3 and now Im blind, thanks...
its ciri aka cirila jeremy :(
what u are waiting for? play the games! the games!!!
I was a bit bored by it tbh. And I really liked the games so it&#39;s not that I know nothing about the lore.
Pitchfork hehe
This fucker hasn&#39;t played the games yet dont watch video just watch the ads
please play Witcher 3 bro.. you&#39;re missing out too much! at least finish the main quest once!
The Witcher 3 is my favorite open world RPG.
The voice is just like the game. So it didn‚Äôt feel weird for people who‚Äôve played the game.
I really don‚Äôt see why anyone would get mad because you haven‚Äôt played the games. Anyway, it‚Äôs probably a safe move, because it will ruin other games for you because it‚Äôs so good.
Renfri is Arya done right
Personally, I liked The Witcher better than Game of Thrones.  But then I hated GoT, books and show.
Playing through Witcher 3 now and it‚Äôs really hard to nail down that level of Asshole-good guy that Henry Cavill does in the show lol
The only thing I didn&#39;t like about the Witcher is &quot;fans&quot; complaining about not casting a red head for a certain role.
Jeremy do yourself a favor play the game, you won&#39;t regret it.
The 3rd episode is where I actually realized that I fuck with the show
The biggest difference between the show and the game is that everything that didn&#39;t feel, or look real in the show is so much more so in the games other than that it&#39;s pretty on point.
‚ÄúI guess <i>controversy</i> might be strong term‚Äî there were some tweets!‚Äù (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=2m34s"">2:34</a>)
Jeremy: <b>about Yennefer</b> Did she fucking teleport?<br>Show: <b>immediately when Yennefer is introduced she makes a portal</b><br>Me: Yeah, prolly.
I think comparing the show with the games is not necessary. Because of the time gap and because they said specifically that they are doing their own interpretation.
Honestly I think I enjoyed The Witcher season 1 more than GoT season 1.  I LOVED how if you weren&#39;t paying attention you&#39;d be lost.  And I think a lot of people weren&#39;t paying attention.  Feltest being the king in Geralts time scene, then being a boy (with his sister;)) in Yennefer&#39;s scene for example.  And when Renfri said that the queen from cintra just won her first battle, but we see her as a grandmother and die.  Loved it!!  I&#39;m also happy that they don&#39;t shy away from magic and monsters.  I love it all.  Great show.
Cant wait for your witcher 3 game review - I loved the game, only played number 3. Realy did like the show.  Great review, as always
Good series, but the Dragon was so fucking goofy looking. Poor execution that episode.
Dude  the voice thing.... dropped it at 4ep üíîüíîüíîüíîü§ï confusing and the sub plots were  just put in the for sake of putting  them there the church thing and the law of surprise thing were so random ü§î...... or maybe its just coz i dont like these mission like shows where by every episode is a different  mission
The best episode to me was episode 6 (the one with the dragon) because it felt like a D&amp;D campaign with the whole party and everything. Loved Jaskier&#39;s character so much, as well as all the other characters. It seems like all of the actors in this show just &#39;get&#39; the character they&#39;re playing, the acting is just so strong. <br>Speaking of strong, can we take a moment to appreciate some of those action scenes? Especially the one in the first episode of Geralt fighting all those dudes in the town, shit was shot so well and the soundtrack SLAPS. (Toss a Coin to your Witcher!)<br>The whole passage of time thing was overall pretty cool. I&#39;ve always been a fan of non-linear narratives so the reveal that the storylines weren&#39;t happening at the same time was fantastic. Only complaint there is how Jaskier doesn&#39;t seem to age at all. Makes sense for Yen and Geralt, but Jaskier is simply human.<br>Honestly, I liked the show so much that I brushed up on some of the lore and discovered that I had access to The Witcher 3 on xbox game pass, so my social life has been non-existant as of right now. Really enjoying getting into this series as a whole
Play witcher 3 a great intro to the series it&#39;s on ps4 and xbox
Didn‚Äôt know a thing about the Witcher going in. But it‚Äôs got me hooked. I love stories that take place in a well fleshed out universe with a rich history and lore. Also loved Henry in this, definitely my favorite character.
Toss a coin song is season 1 of the witcher.
NO JASKIER?! <br><br>YOUUUU...NEEED A NAP!
I knew nothing of this series going in and almost gave up until Jaskier showed up. Then I read just a quick synopsis of the characters and world and made it much easier to follow. Good show.
Anybody else seen the claymore similarities... no... just me. OK
Since I played the games and read the books, I&#39;m too critical of it. I ended the witcher with a m3h due to casting choices mainly.<br>Honestly, at this point I don&#39;t care one way or another for another season. It hasn&#39;t won me over yet.
I can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt play the games!!!
The shoe took its time to get started, but really took off with the episode on the Striga. Most visceral fight scene in the whole series.
The unexplained flashbacks confused me.  I like stories to have a logical progression.  Other than that I&#39;m liking it.
Read the books, it&#39;s the best.
Imo episode 3 is moment when i got hooked into a show.<br>First episode is lot of lore and story that is hard to catch <br><br><br><br><br>Spoilers: in moment when you figure you watch 2 different timelines and that&#39;s why first 2 episodes were kind a random
First episode was awesome and last one, the rest suck donkey dick. Witcher 3 has everything better than the serie.
I‚Äôm 5 episodes in. Already played the third game. So far, I‚Äôd say on the plus side: the casting and acting are great, Cavill nails Geralt, the writing is for the most part excellent, the action sequences are satisfying, the world feels real and the characters feel three-dimensional. A few minuses: Yennefer‚Äôs back-story felt rushed and therefore a bit so-what; Jaskier - sorry, just don‚Äôt like the character (a fault in the original books, I suspect); and the naff factor, so hard to eliminate in the epic fantasy genre, crept in at important moments. But all in all, a very good start.
I enjoyed the way the time was in the show I didn‚Äôt realize it till the 3rd or 4th episode it blew my mind high key
Witcher‚Äôs are children giving up for experiment
R.i.p Jeremy jahns games review 2020 didn‚Äôt play the witcher and probably where not gonna get a Death Stranding review.
Agree with your pros and cons but for me the whole endless driving up and down the timeline annoyed and confused me. And the constant ‚Äúwhere are we now? Oh well, who cares‚Äù location-leaping was irritating because, as you say. the characters are likeable and their general arcs are good.
Play the game bro!
The actress that plays Yeneffer isn&#39;t beautiful enough for the role.
Play witcher 3 you fucking crazy bastard.
Is only me who thinks it would be cool af if Mark hamil played Vesemir?
I agree with everything you said exactly. I can&#39;t wait for more. I wish it would take on more of the game story lines but I&#39;m good either way.
The games are better than both books and the series.
The Witcher reminds me of a shithouse version of Xena: Warrior Princess with hammy acting and poor CGI but 1 or 2 interesting characters. That Jaskier guy was horrid, Ciri was boring AF. I kept imagining Geralt was Rhaegar Targaryan and Yennifer&#39;s story was literally INDENTICAL to Morgan Le Fey (Helena Bonham Carter) in Merlin. The deformed ugly witch who transforms herself into a beautiful Sorceress....lazy lazy lazy....*yawn*. The Yennifer girl is all about T&amp;A titilation for the male audience as we see her tits in pretty much EVERY episode...wtf...but her face is pretty average even after the transformation. The eyes thing was weird...Why didn&#39;t D&amp;D just CGI Dany&#39;s eyes in GOT? Her&#39;s were supposed to be purple like Yen&#39;s... too....hmmm...too busy spending on Dragon CGI.
this season 1 is a perfect prequel for witcher 3. you&#39;ll still have that same feeling for geralt and ciri though. and Yennefer&#39;s still chasing something in the game and her pursuit in skellige finally clicks through this series.
‚ÄúLol ok thats a cgi monster‚ÄùüòÇü§£
I think The Witcher is well made. And Cavill is a perfect choice. But, I don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s much depth to it. I don&#39;t really care about any of the characters. The first season should be used to develop the back story. But, I don&#39;t see that. I still haven&#39;t watched the whole season, so maybe I&#39;ll change my mind at the end. But, so far? Meh.
The series sucks. Just trust me on this one. Compared to both the games and the books it sucks. Coming from a guy who liked the first two seasons of game of thrones more then the respected books
As someone who‚Äôs played the Witcher, feel like the series was <b>supposed</b> to be good, but the signature Netflix timeline jumpiness kinda ruined it for me. If people are gonna try to compare it to game of thrones, I will say this; Game of Thrones never left me confused.
Never read witcher books or played the games. But man i watched this and i love it.
I know why the Witcher talks that way. He needs to take a shit.
You should really try playing it! i never played the game before the series came out.<br>I was surprised of how good the game was.
What about Jaskier and Roach?
Has he seen Star Wars?  What about the Matrix?  Has he played a Zelda game?  Does he know what the Lord of the Rings is?  All fair questions now.
This is actually a perfect review of this show
I hadn‚Äôt played the game too but downloaded after watching the first season
The first two books (which this season is based off of) are short story novels. So perhaps that contributes to the passage of time ‚Äúissue‚Äù. But yes it is a bit jarring when you see the small hints of vast passages of time. However, It‚Äôs also neat  how Yennefer and Geralt‚Äôs slowed aging attributes to how much time passes between their arcs. Yen being the first to undergo this has her arc told within a Century while Geralt‚Äôs spans around 50-60 years and Ciri‚Äôs is told in the span of a week or so.
I don&#39;t think this show have enough people to rival GOT . Fucking GOT was killing good characters every season
I felt Netflix could do 2 more episodes. One about Yennefer on court doing nasty things for rulers and second about Nilfgaard explaining their view and motivation, because now, for people outside the lore, they like those Orcs who want to just destroy everything.
I agree with the passage of time part to an extent. I liked how it just didn&#39;t throw text on a screen but they probably could&#39;ve done a little more to portray it better. Whether it be more obvious changes to how the character looked or slight alterations to their personality to parallel what they&#39;ve been through. But man I loved not just getting tossed text haha the jumpiness helped keep me intreged
Never read the books, played the first couple hours of The Witcher 3, thought it was amazing but for some reason never picked it back up. Loved the show though, makes me wanna delve back into wild hunt and give it a proper go
play the game and read the books man, tis good.
Jaskier‚Äôs age finna be the biggest plot hole
They could have done the dragons better to be fair! Haha
Jaskierrrrrrrrrr
But the best sword fights are in the first episode! I loooove Renfri though. I know many people dgaf about her. My lesbian ass was like oh I am slayed. Also totally agree they screwed up Ciri‚Äôs storyline so much. I‚Äôve now watched it 6 times and I have picked up on some amazingly tiny moments that when I picked it up that damnnnnn
man this is just my personal opinion, but the show sucks... like really bad. It felt so cheap. It was like I was watching those old tv shows Xena and Hercules. And the main character definitely borrowed Ares costume from tv show &quot;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&quot;...
Yeah time flow was more of time jumping not just forward but also backwards there is no way to tell when a specific scene is happening or its order
Review : Netflix blew it, The series Sucked too much, Netflix didn&#39;t do The Witcher books any justice. It can&#39;t even compare to GOT S1
I haven‚Äôt played the game but I still like it
Yennifer hooked me in the series sorry Geralt.
Passage of time is actually one of the best parts of the show. It makes it very interesting to watch as you are required to connect the dots, compared to the normal linear story timeline.
dude what&#39;s wrong with your hair?
Hahaha his voice!
The writing destroyed this golden opportunity to bring such a cool story to cinema.
Jeremy! Please review of The Haunting of Hill House season 1. Season 2 will be coming out this year. Its my favorite show show and youre my favorite reviewer! Please? üòÑ
roach was the only likeable character hahaha
Yeah the CG was very so-so! Which was weird because where did all that money go?! JUST to the casting?! I really liked the Striga personally.
PSA to everyone that the Witcher audiobooks are free on youtube.
Jaskier was annoying and did his role quite well. I even missed his presence!
I‚Äôll be honest, I did not have high hopes for this series. Henry Cavill nailed Geralt, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting; in fact the entire cast did great. The story was a little convoluted (I got the whole time skipping pretty quick) but some scenes/topics I‚Äôd like to have had more time with seemed rushed, and others seemed dragged out, and the action from the first episode didn‚Äôt feel as intense in the following ones. I still loved the show, just my small gripes.<br><br>And the lack of red hair a certain sorceress had (I know it‚Äôs CD‚Äôs interpretation, so I respect them being faithful to the books. But I can dream goddammit).
Jeremy doing the beatbox was the best part of the video.
I didn&#39;t like the show.. Very boring in my opinion üôÑ
Yennifer episode 3: I chose to give up my baby maker for beauty, power and position <br><br>2 episodes later Yennifer: i want a child! They stole that chance from me and I wasn‚Äôt give a choice!!
I liked Ciri she seems quite mysterious, but I do see what you mean she&#39;s definitely at her own place in the story, you also have to know she&#39;s the present Ciri, while Geralt and Yennefer where in the past through out the entire season. I&#39;m waiting for my brother to beat Witcher 3 before I play it. I&#39;m probably going to read the books until then because well, after the Netflix it seemed interesting, so why not? ü§òüòÇ
Ironically, because I doubt you‚Äôd know this, but Geralt can‚Äôt block pitchforks either with his leather jacket either.
Yennefer is easily the best part about this series so far but, my only gripe having played the games and seen her is the choice of casting. Anya Chalotra is great in this role and I got nothing against her personally but she seems too young to play Yennefer. She‚Äôs closer in age to the actress who plays Ciri than Henry Cavill is to her. Yennefer should be taller and more around Geralt age and maturity. (Yennefer in the games looks almost EXACTLY like the actress Eva Green. A casting choice that probably would have been to obvious to take seriously though) This woman barely looks like she‚Äôs out of her teens. <br>Yet that is a small complaint compared to the rest of what this show has to offer! <br>Hoping so where this goes in a season 2!
I hope by season 2, no one will mention &quot;game of thrones&quot; in any witcher video.
The reason I enjoy Jeremys reviews is because he looks at movies as an average joe. That said sometimes that is to the detriment of the review. The complicated timeline made it interesting to me it didn‚Äôt detract. If you don‚Äôt want to have to think then you probably won‚Äôt like it. Also I have exact opposite opinion about the mandalorians CGI. It was easily the worst part of the show for me and the Witcher‚Äôs was actually better then I thought it was going to be.
I haven&#39;t played the games yet either or read the books, so the Netflix series was my entry point.<br>Agree on exactly the same points you mentioned as the main ones:<br>- Yennifer&#39;s story is the best so far<br>- Ciri&#39;s is mundane so far<br>- Episode 5 (I think) confused the heck out of me until I realized that the character story threads were FAR from occuring simultaneously. No indication beforehand that they were asynchronous.
the first episode i thought calanthe was just another generic queen but she surprisingly came off as pretty badass imo
Did you guys knew that there is actually an original Polish Witcher series with 13 episodes. Considering it is from the year 2002, the quality is actually good. It narrates the story in a perfect way!There is also a movie of the same production company. Wiedzjiem
Toss a coin to your Witcher oh valley of plenty..
Does he play a few rounds of Gwent?
Witcher 3 is actually my favorite game of all time... Got me to listen to all the translated works on audiobook. Witcher 1 and 2 were good but 3 to me was a master piece.
My father doesn&#39;t even play video games, he thought the show was really good.....  hes been very down since game of thrones ended so poorly
The thing is the series did a bad job in presenting the world and characters and tossed everything at once at you. If one did not play the games or read the books,  one will not even grasp the idea behind witchers...  That is the biggest problem these fuckers like the directors did to ruin the show,  not to mention the shitty changes and arbitrary representation quotas they introduced...
GET HIM!    - - - - E
Forced diversity
When he zipped up his jacket to protect from pitchforks, I thought he was making a reference to the Rivian Pogrom XD
Go play The Witcher 3 Jeremy you‚Äôll love it
Haven&#39;t played Witcher 3? I think you should rectify that immedaitely imo.
The battle of the mages was lame.
compare to the game? then its terrible. Compare it to the books? its ok.
I loved how they were able to introduce into the series the concept that all choices have consequences. There is never a &quot;right&quot; choice. Whatever the character does, it will have ripple effects for good and for worse, and they are able to portray the moral dilemmas that the characters face each time.
Netflix Witcher is good. 1st season was definitely worth of watching. However there are few problems.<br>1. When it comes to story it is very far from the books. Well perhaps it is not a flaw but I just cant stop comparing. But I guess it is just me unreasonable.<br>2. I do however have one more objective problem which many of my friends who played/readed Witcher or even have first contact with him on Netflix share with me. It is clear that show doesn&#39;t sygnalise properly that certain events are happening in completely different time.<br>3. They try to introduce too many characters at once. In two first books Ciri appeared in 1 full chapter and at the end of final chapter of the second book. Yennefer were very important in 3 chapters.<br>1st season which is losely based on books #1 and #2 works hard on story lines of these 3 characters nearly from the beginning. Ciri were in 1st episode already and Yennefer in 2nd.<br>Dont get me wrong these characters became very important in Witcher books but I feel that Netflix was scared that if they wont show them very soon Witcher 3:Wild Hunt fans will stop watching.<br>I feel that many things in show were shortened and simplified because of Netflix drive to put Yennefer and Ciri in spotlight so early.<br>4. They are excessive with bad language. It definitely was present in books and games but they employ it 10-20% too often. It might get boring after 3-4 seasons.
Dude, you need to play Witcher 3
you havent played the witcher games???? Sir i shall leave you a hateful comment.... You Suck
1st episode was slow.  30 minutes in I remember yelling &quot;is SOMETHING going to happen??&quot;<br>Glad I stuck with it
Roach was the best waifu-horse.
For the love of God.... PLAY THE GAME üòÇ
Yennefer was good but naaaaaaa Jeremy, Cavill really steals the show he is perfect as Geralt.
Actually, I value the opinion of people who have not played the games as their popularity no doubt skews opinion (mine included).
Lots of diversity in this show that is about medieval Europe.
I really like the witcher, and only thing I didn&#39;t like and it&#39;s not very that big of a deal, and the race benders. Don&#39;t like they change triss character but as I said it&#39;s not that big of a deal, the show being good as it is makes up for a lot of the flaws.
I‚Äôll be 100% honest, I was playing Witcher 3 before I even knew there was a Netflix show, so hearing references to the past in the games, and seeing those scenes in the show was crazy for me. Example, Yennefer trying to control the Djinn is referenced, as well as Geralts last wish, which are referenced multiple times in the game. One thing I didn‚Äôt like was the over mixing of races. I don‚Äôt mind having mixed or black people playing key roles, such as the sorceress for Novigrad, but Triss? I don‚Äôt know, we haven‚Äôt had much time with Triss yet, so I can‚Äôt speak to the actress, but in my eyes, it‚Äôs a little odd seeing the bright Red hair in games, and seeing a mixed actress on TV. In saying this (hoping I don‚Äôt get ripped for it) I haven‚Äôt read the books yet, maybe Triss is completely different to both adaptations in the books.
I thought Yennefer wanted to look beautiful... Why didn&#39;t it happen?
I‚Äôve only played Witcher 3 (which I loved) and after watching the season I didn‚Äôt like it. It didn‚Äôt set up the stakes well, the timeline discontinuity is jarring and the story fails as a stand-alone adaptation since it seems it‚Äôs assuming viewers are familiar with the premises of the Witcher world and don‚Äôt take time to explain things.
I mean, I&#39;m glad (because it&#39;ll get a bigger budget come season 2) but so surprised people liked the show so much. I really, really didn&#39;t. Admittedly, I&#39;m a huge fan of the games and they&#39;re always going to be my favorite interpretation. I do think the show really dropped the ball on several elements though. A lot of people liked Yennefer and at this point I have to just tell myself it&#39;s a reimagining of the character because I really don&#39;t think Yen from the show in any way resembles Yen from the source material. (Not talking physically, although that is a factor - actor seems a bit young)<br>I also thing the show does an appalling job of creating any sort of identity for itself. The costuming and set design are just abysmal. You can&#39;t tell who is from where or what their station is or whether they&#39;re a sorcerer or anything. There&#39;s nothing interesting about any of the design choices, no life to any of it. There are a few times where this is so glaringly bad that it just took me out of the show entirely. There&#39;s some really weird sound design in the earlier episodes. The magic looks so bad. Comical at times. By the end, I was so frustrated by just about everything. <br>All that being said, most of its biggest flaws can be overcome with more money and a bit more time and care on certain elements. Maybe a better writing team as well, if we&#39;re lucky.
A very fair balanced review. A good show with improvement to be made. A good season 1 overall
Read the books, Jeremy.
sorceress like yenefer do use teleportation a lot, its part of there lore
Time to light the torches...
I agree so much with the passage of time thing. I legit thought I missed an episode at like episode 5 or 6. I was like wait what?
Most comments here:<br>&quot;Dunno if leather protect from pitchfork&quot;
The show is trash. A disappointment for me.
There&#39;s no comparison, game tells a better story than the series
Henry talks exactly the same as the Ingame Geralt! He did such an amazing job!<br><br>PLAY THE GAME! xD
Mmmmhhmm<br>Sssshhhhhh..... Fuuuuck
The problem with the Witcher is that it was definitely made for people who either like or are familiar with the Witcher series (books &amp; games). It might not actually be a bad thing because I definitely enjoyed and everyone I know who&#39;s seen it, have also enjoyed it, then again all of us have either played or read the books. The thing is that there were definitely a couple of times where the scene would cut to a monster or character without any real explanation and I thought, &quot;oh yeah there&#39;s that thing I&#39;ve seen from the game&quot; and I also thought &quot;man it must definitely be weird if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking at&quot;. I loved the series, but it&#39;s mostly because I was already a fan, and sadly that might be the reason as to why season 2 might not do so well.
Well actually IMO Yennefer was the worst part of the series
Cool hair man
I just wanna say... I watch your videos all the time, but this one made me become a subscriber. Honestly, it was the &quot;mmmmm fuck&quot; lolü§£ü§£ü§£
8/10 video - too little Jaskier ;)
Here‚Äôs my review. It‚Äôs harsh, and I don‚Äôt expect everyone to agree. But it‚Äôs what I saw when I watched The Witcher.<br><br>Acting is great, CGI is realistic, costumes are phenomenal, choreography is good. Cinematography is decent, lacking a few landscape shots, but whatever.<br>The production quality is incredible.<br><br>But the writing. By god. The writing is atrocious.<br><br>Characters? No motive, no goals, no connections. They have charisma, but no history, no identity. <br>Yennefer is decent to begin with, having a struggle we can empathize with, but then it vanishes. The one thing that gives her depth, her disfigurement, fixed in one episode. Her arch is completed, and once it is, there‚Äôs nothing left for her.<br>-<br>World? No nation feels any different from another.  When we travel from place to place it is always confusing. Scenes just don‚Äôt link up properly.<br>Are we in Skellige when the Queen has her party? She‚Äôs from Skellige, but that‚Äôs an island separated from the mainland... Why didn‚Äôt they ever emphasize that?<br>-<br>Plot? Disjointed. Unfocused. There is no true plot at the center of the story, only undeveloped characters who go about their separate lives. <br>Everything is explained with and hinges on, ‚ÄúDestiny‚Äù<br>-<br>Pacing? Well, I have no idea what we are building to, so the question of how well things are building is irrelevant. The show isn‚Äôt slow or fast, it‚Äôs just kinda... There... Doin it‚Äôs thing...<br><br>20 year time skips happen randomly without an understandable reason, and then we, skip, right, back? I have no idea. I don‚Äôt know where we are half the time, and I never know WHEN we are either. But you know what, I don‚Äôt think it matters. Since there‚Äôs no plot, time is irrelevant. <br>How crazy is that, a story where the order of events is irrelevant. Seriously, the only thing tying plots together on a timeline is when a character will just outright say something along the lines of,<br>‚ÄúHey, this happened to me a while back.‚Äù<br><br>There is a sort of plot that draws characters together, the conquest of Nilfgaard. But if they are so important to the plot, who are they? Where did they come from? Why are they evil? How are they so powerful? Who is their leader? Why do people fight for them? What do they want? How long have they been around? Who is that guy with the bow?!<br>... The answer to these questions?<br>‚ÄúThey wear black clothes, they eeeeevil‚Äù<br>Seriously, we don‚Äôt know anything about anyone for Nilfgaard. Why not?<br>The center piece of the story, the conflict that ties everything together, and it is completely undefined...<br><br>And that big moment at the end where two major characters finally meet up for the first time. <br>What climactic event brings them together?<br>... Magic did it?<br>I don‚Äôt know, there‚Äôs a lot of nonsensical serendipity thrown around here.<br>‚ÄúDESTINY‚Äù<br>At one point Geralt runs into an Elven Prince who just stole some food from a random shlup. As he is the first elf we meet, naturally, throws some jarring exposition at us and then disappears forever. Both the supposed Elven Prince and all 3 of his friends.<br><br>To me, writing is everything. The show could have been great, watch a single scene and it is phenomenal. Acting, costumes, CGI, all great. But the writing can‚Äôt hold it together.<br><br>So yeah, I thought it was bad. Let me know if you agree. Or let me know how I‚Äôm wrong.<br><br>I‚Äôll leave you with a lil poem...<br>Don‚Äôt be a mindless fan, cycling about, blowing your lukewarm air on everything.
The show will be enough until Middle Earth arrives and then it can just fuck off.
The story is good but the Characters are played perfectly. Its this characters that mae you want to know more about The Witcher.
Watched the first episode, it was great..... To cure my insomnia.
Watch peaky blinders
6/10 for me.<br>Felt like they did Roach injustice but not making him run up a hill on his front legs or get stuck on fences and trees
Played it, read it, seen it, liked it.
Ciri&#39;s story will get better later on, just a bit of a slow start with her. I get that time passing was hard to tell with both yen and geralt not aging much, I liked that though, it was fun to figure out when it was set
I havnt played the witcher wat is it
HATEFUL COMMENTS!!!!! PLAY THE GAME DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR
I hated yennefer lol
Bout dam time
I so the all thing within 3 days üòÇüòÇ and I loved it
It is ok you didn&#39;t  play the game....but read a book man!
Season 1 is based on the collection of short stories a sort of prequel to main story. The main story should take place starting in season 2. It&#39;s actually a very good book series and unlike Game of Throne it has a ending.
I played all the games and I just watched the first ep so I‚Äôll just this....<br><br>‚Äú50% disappointing/50% Meh.....‚Äù
You should score Netflix and other streaming service originals by wether they are worth subscribing for!
What are you doing dude? Play the fucking game will you.
I twigged the timeline thing at Yennifer&#39;s graduation where you see a young Foltest messing with his sister (in a familial way) there were a few throwaway lines referring to the passage of time. Jaskier saying he and Geralt had been friends for ten years, Yen saying she&#39;d been in court for 30 etc. It could have been done better with more of a nod to the fact it was a different timeleine anjd is the only consistant complaint I&#39;ve seen about the series. Well, that and the casting of Triss and the forced diversity. The black fella playing a knight of cintra for example looked as out of place as a white man playing one of the Zulus charging Michael Caine.
Cavil&#39;s Witcher voice is what Bale&#39;s Batman voice SHOULD have sounded like.  &#39;Cause even though I knew it wasn&#39;t Cavil&#39;s natural voice, it always sounded cool And believable.  Bale&#39;s Batman voice FUCK&#39;N Sucked!!!  It sounded lame as fuck every time he opened his mouth.
I love Yennefer
Watched first three episodes........dull dull dull, badly acted boring total rubbish avoid like the plague
ciris story was definetly the weakest part of the season...and guess what, its the part with the most creative liberties.  as in, its almost 100% fabricated.<br><br>the brokilon sequence is actually supposed to happen several years before the fall of cintra and her and geralt run into each other there.
Do yourself the biggest favor possible and listen to The Witcher audiobooks.<br>Top shelf Fantasy genre
Passage of time is definitely a problem, but I still was hooked and want more!
Thank I wasn‚Äôt the only one who thought of Siri when I found out the princess‚Äôs name üòÇ
Jeremy u may have heard this and figured but ciri&#39;s story really doesn&#39;t connect into the main story until later. only watched until ep8 tho
I haven&#39;t played the games either, but having played a ton of RPG games I loved it. It did take me a few episodes to get into it.
So what we are all wanting to know is are you going to play the games now?? Or at least the 3 one
What?? You haven&#39;t played the Witcher games?!?<br><br>Neither have I.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=2m31s"">2:31</a> &quot;Yennefer was great. Her .... tragedy (hands on the boobs) is really the heart of story&quot;. Agreed :D
Okay.... I am vastly in the minority. Never Heard of the books, never played the games.  Just watched the show.  I liked it.  But I still feel Henry Cavill can&#39;t act. Felt like it when he was Superman, felt like it in his mission impossible roll, felt like it here. I will say he had a lot of fun playing in this particular universe, and it was noticeable. But I just don&#39;t think he really is natural in any roll he has picked so far. Okay, I&#39;ll Dodge the pitchforks too.
Holy shit that party analogy was on point haha
magical mutant people - ffs do some research
Jeremy should react to every trailer of Witcher 3, I&#39;ll Binge that!
i have no idea how people think this show is evan ok beside the shit book version and blah blah blah its just made bad lol the cinematography the make up the voice acting is fucking bad lol
The games is valid John only reason why I‚Äùm so hype for cyberpunk true craftsmanship
PLAY THE WITCHER 3. ON THE SWITCH IF YOU HAVE TO. BUT FOR CHRISTS SAKE MAN. PLAY IT.
You haven‚Äôt..... played.... the Witcher..... games?!?!
Just watching it, huh? Honestly, I think this was a great story. Acting wise...? The females carry the show. I think Henry did a &quot;good&quot; job, but I think he needs more depth in his acting range, even if the character isn&#39;t supposed to be emotional. Wesley Snipes does it the best though. (Blade)
I am glad you liked it, you will Love the books and the game, if you end up playing them...
Need a Witcher game review from you!!
Hadn‚Äôt played the games. Still liked it
I immediately rewatched the season after I finished it!!!!
EXACTLY how I felt!
@ Jeremy Jahns  The witcher books came before game of thrones shut up!
Henry Cavill Charisma? Huh?
Yes! Passage of Time was a big issue for me.
Have not played the games or read the books, but I loved it! Yen is also my favorite character too, with Geralt as my second. I can&#39;t wait for season 2! I actually liked it more than The Mandalorian. I also really liked how they told the story in three different time lines without really making it obvious. I admit it was a little confusing at some points in the beginning because of that, but I thought it was fun, especially once it clicked and I was like oh, that&#39;s so cool! Haha.
I loved the show. I didn&#39;t play the Witcher games myself but watched let&#39;s plays so I understand the story well and thought they did a great job on early life of the characters and with the time jumps to keep everyone in the story.
You definitely should play TW3 especially if you are into RPGs
Jeremy, you could do a Witcher 3 review and it would still be fresh. That&#39;s how popular this game still is.
It may as well have been called &quot;The Yennefer&quot;, this season was mostly her story.
Thanks for watching and reviewing this.
Jeremy, my man, you really really should play Wild Hunt. Judging by content you reviewed before, you&#39;re going to love it.<br>By the way, passage of time is even more messed up than you think. Yen spent about 20 years in magic school, than few dozen years playing politics, than another several decades galavanting on her own trying to find a cure for infertility. When she finally meets Geralt, she is like 90 years old. Hottest grandma ever XD
No mention of Jaskier or his epic ballad. How dare you? üòÇ I‚Äôm really glad you liked it though. Hooked me for sure üëçüèª
Yeah boiiii
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m46s"">0:46</a> It‚Äôs funny that Jeremy claims to know very little about The Witcher franchise but his comment about pitchforks near the beginning made me think he knew all about it. <br><br>Because Sir Geralt of Rivia was slain by a young human lad who stabbed him with a pitchfork in a race riot. <br><br>Where the White Wolf was doing his best to defend elves, dwarves and other non humans from humans.
Jeremy I whole heartedly encourage you to play the games
Awesome review, fully relate
Yep, the passage of time took an episode or two for me to catch up to, even though I&#39;ve read all the books.
<i>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather blocks pitchforks‚Äù</i><br><br>Mayhaps we&#39;ll find out... ;)
Books ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Every review, I learn more and more about Jeremy‚Äôs kinks
First episode I felt lost and almost stopped watching. But yea 2nd episode about yennefer drew me in.
The beginning of the show was a little difficult for me to understand but the middle to end of the show was super good, I‚Äôm looking forward to the next season and I hope there‚Äôs many to come. I also hope they follow the wild hunt storyline because the storyline in the game was AMAZING
Jerremy are you sure it was CGI check the stunt video for the show its mostly practicall like the striga fight
Jeremy made the right choice...
The time continuity thing is something that is very present in the books as well. Specifically in the first two books this season is based off. The first two books are collections of short stories that jump back and forth in time quite a lot, and having read the books I was better prepared for this in the show, but I can see how that would confuse some people who are new to the story.
What is happening to your hair, mate?
&quot;Siri, what is the name of the princess in the Witcher?&quot;<br><b>15 mins later</b><br>&quot;Damn it! yes that&#39;s you but what&#39;s her name??&quot;
I like it but people should stop saying it next got cus it will never be
The way he gestures Yennefer¬¥s &quot;tragedy&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> suggests the real reason he likes her...
Read the books, goddamit.
We need Sean Bean to play Vesemir üôåüèª
The reason, I feel, Yennefer was better handled was because the showrunner didn‚Äôt want to focus on Geralt, but on the ‚Äòstrong female character‚Äô. And as the series progresses I am fairly confident Geralt will have less and less on an important role in the plot.
Haven&#39;t played the games but I read the books years ago and the books are the best, go read them!!
Seriously?... Yenefer?...<br>Yenefer of Vengerberg is the worst of the show.   You are a joke.
Took me 4 episodes to get into the show.
Same here, I went into this blind, not knowing anything about the lore and ended up loving it
U don‚Äôt need to play the games but, the books r better to understand
Did you have to mentioned GoT? That‚Äôs such a cheap comparison. <br>They are totally different... both good in there own right but that‚Äôs like saying GoT is like LOTR because it‚Äôs set in a medieval time period.<br>Also I think they spent too much time with Yennefer...<br>I mean it‚Äôs called the Witcher but I have barley any backstory on him and all this backstory on witch that goes in and out of Geralts life. <br><br>That is my only gripe
Jeremy and other famous reviewer are not doing a real review they are just giving want the fans want to hear, they just want to avoid all the drama and toxicity from the fans.<br>No matter how much money you put on costumes/cgi/fight&amp;action scenes if the &quot;WRITING&quot; is bad the show will be bad.<br>The main problem is the show-runner lauren (worst show-runner in my opinion) and her (beginner level) writer team, the &quot;WRITINGS&quot; on the show is not just bad its extremely terrible like 1-10 terrible, the show have no soul in it everything is a mess.
You need to try witcher 3 ‚ù§Ô∏è
@jeremyjahns review Santa claritas diet... probably one of the funniest shows to have aired in general but the funniest on netflix..
Just go and play Witcher 3. You will get realy involved. Like Death Stranding or Last of Us
Series takes place before the games <br><br>You dont really need to have played the games
Now go and play the games.
It was originally a book series, a series based on Polish Folklore.
My favorite character was Mousesack
Didnt like it, feel lost 90% of the time... or felt asleep (HIGHE FAN OF THE GAME BTW)
Should be called The Yennefer.<br>:)<br>Just to annoy Andrew Klaven.
Scumbag play the witcher games!!!
I also haven&#39;t reads the books or played the games, and I agree with everything you just said. The first couple episodes are a bit odd, but then when you figure out what&#39;s up and you get invested in the characters and what the show is, it&#39;s great. Can&#39;t wait for season 2.
In the books, Geralt&#39;s voice is described as &quot;metallic&quot; and &quot;unpleasant&quot;. hence the voice in the show and the games :)
Gotta disagree with you on the CGI thing
U defiantly should play the game. An absolute masterpiece üëå
yennefers writing misses on the back end. She is told what the glamor will cost her and not only is it not forced on her she forces it to happen. then in the end she acts and talks like it was forced on her against her will.
F!$&amp; you JJ for not playing the game !!!!!!!!   Jk. You‚Äôre awesome.  Love your channel.  But your really need to play the game.  Best game ever !!!
Yeah, the forest scenes with ciri were annoying.
The pilot is pretty boring, to be honest.
Even I played the Witcher once üòÇ And I don&#39;t play games much.
Haven&#39;t played the games, or read the books. Just watched 3 episodes. It&#39;s okay so far
I never played the games myself  but want to
I just bought the switch version OC the Witcher on Black Friday (got 10 bucks off) and I watched the series first then started playing. I‚Äôm enjoying both :)
Henry Cavill has played the Witcher...Jeremy please get on your butt and play too, no excuses. Then do another review. Want to see how this review changes through a different lens. You have 1 month - enjoy the shit out of Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
Yennefer was also my favorite character! Fuck, some of her performances made me genuinely uncomfortable with how much raw emotion was in it. Some of her scenes were so DAMN intense. I just loved it. And the part where * SPOILERS *<br><br>She tried to save the baby üò¢ that shit fuckin broke my heart. And the speech she gives to try to convince herself the baby was better of dead than alive, when you can tell she doesn‚Äôt truly believe that at her core, augh. So good.
This show had a major problem with jumping between past and present and not doing enough to make you aware until you‚Äôre like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she dead? Isn‚Äôt he dead? Why are they talking to Geralt? Wtf?‚Äù
I played witcher 3 for about 8hrs (yes I dropped it) <br>It&#39;s definitely overrated<br>It&#39;s no where near perfect that fans claim it to be<br>It&#39;s a decent game<br>Gorgeous world<br>Good characters<br>Terrible skill tree(worst)<br>Mediocre combat ( just so you know I beat the werewolf) <br><br>The last 2 are a gamebreaker for me <br>I give witcher 3 a 7.5/10<br>It was so boring (the progression was very unrewarding) I dropped it <br>I went as far as turning the Botchling into a Lubberkin
Guess I&#39;ll try to watch episode 2 then.
I‚Äôve played a bit of the Witcher games but the Netflix series is what got me to read the books (which i have been doing lately) and to be honest, i think they have been doing a great job. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2! Good review!
Should have opted for the leather jacket+1 to be safe! XD
There is not that many left because they can&#39;t make more. they say it in the series
You shouldn‚Äôt have to play a video games or read the books to enjoy something. Everything should be judged and enjoyed for how it is being presented to you. I like the show no prerequisite required.
I really wish people would stop comparing it to GoT
Jeremy you are like a cool coworker I would actually like to chat with.
I love how this entire comment section is just speaking about the actual ending of the main story and we are only at S1.  ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)
Scene &quot; Toss a Coin to....&quot;<br>Jeremy &quot;Gently press Mute on Remote&quot;
After the second episode, we binged the entire series in 2 days. xp It&#39;s really good, and now I&#39;m reading the books.
Please review Netflix‚Äôs Draculaüôèüßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶áü¶á
P.S. Jeremy your hair is looking VERY fluffy today. That is all.
The Witcher was good the 1st time I watched it, but heard to watch it a 2nd time and it would make it better and more understandable....was a good choice to watch it twice and put all the pieces together.
I liked it from get go and given Henry wanted the roll from the beginning, makes him so better.
Ciri should‚Äôve just been in the very ending, as part of Geralt‚Äôs ‚Äòdestiny‚Äô they keep referring to. Her whole arc was boring and unnecessary, they didn‚Äôt need to show it instead just pay off her character in the second season.
Play Witcher 3, there‚Äôs a side quest where you do shrooms and solve a mystery with your horse who can talk. 10/10
I wonder if anyone else had a similar experience. <br><br>I bought the Witcher 3 for PS4 years ago. I wanted to love it but I gave it a try once and went straight for the story quest in Velen before I was anywhere near ready for it and couldn‚Äôt get past a bunch of drowners. After getting frustrated it was just on to the next game and never touched it again. <br><br>Then Netflix Witcher comes out, being a huge medieval genre fan I hopped on it. Watched one episode on the first day and then just binged the rest of the series on the second day. <br><br>After wanting more Witcher I finally tried the game again and have been loving every second of it. I learned from my mistakes and made sure I did my research and was prepared. Now I‚Äôm almost 40 hours into it.
Make a review of Mr. Robot!
Own the game, played about 2 hours and stopped... ü§î
Little did Jereny Jahns know how much putchforks will matter later
Would you ever do a Wild hunt review
Henry is trying to do the voice of Geralt from the game and I think he&#39;s doing a pretty good job of it. I thought that was great from the start!<br>Jeremy, play The Witcher 3!
If you like the series you Should play the game
You need to review the new Dracula series on Netflix!
The biggest problem with this series is that it lives in the shadow of Game Of Thrones. It&#39;s enjoyable, but it feels somewhat empty after the baldness of GOT. Just saying.
The witcher is ... Awesomtakular!!!
Play the games man. U will find the game story intriguing and amazing (even the dlc).
It was good, took some liberty&#39;s with the characters and the ending was meh...  but overall good
Loved it and loved Henry Cavill with long white hair and a sword ohhhh yeahhhhh
Yes I agree I too was loving Yennefer titties  I mean her story was moving and tragic. üòÖ
You&#39;ll love the games. Not saying the show sucks or anything like that, &#39;cause that&#39;s what legit draw me into the show. Yes, the show has its flaws, but at least I had a great time with it, like I had with the games. I&#39;m just say that you&#39;ll might love the games once you tried one of them out. Trust me, you won&#39;t be disappointed with the results. I&#39;d recommended the latest game, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
honestly the witcher 3 just wasn&#39;t for me, rpg games usually aren&#39;t to my like, especially fantasy ones.
Too much PC, Too much time jumping
For me Cavil was the best part of the show because he got the whole monster hunter for hire down... and there were a lot of parts I felt like I was being preached at. But I&#39;m more of an Elric fan my self
He..He...he left out jaskier... Do we tell him?
&quot;Stuff takes time&quot;<br>New merch line?
Do yourself a favour and play Wild Hunt. It&#39;s one of my all time favourite games. I&#39;ve played a shit-load of games and never say this.
Glad you enjoyed the show now, GO PLAY THE GAME!!! Wild Hunt might end up being your favorite rpg of all time if not favorite game. If you liked the show you‚Äôll love the game, trust me dude
That party comparison was so accurate.
mate seriously, you liked the tv show and you liked playing skyrim. you will love the witcher 3. what would it take to make you give it a go?
Finally!!!
Whys the screen got a black shadow on the left side the whole time???  Still you&#39;re my go to for reviews! Annnnndddd....the swordplay?????
I just felt the timeline was confusing
Watch A Simple Favor from 2018! It looks like a chick flick at first glance but it&#39;s really bitchen
<b>*</b> Spoiler Alert <b>*</b> <br><br>There are different timelines! It took me two viewings to understand that... in the last episode üòÇ
so happy Ciri is 18
So what does the comment section have to do to get you to play the games?
I just hit level 71 and put on my Grand Master Feline Witcher gear at least do the Baron quest line Jeremy ‚ù§Ô∏è
I will like this review because you had the same opinion as me
I read the books and hated them. Played the game and love it. I think maybe the books are not translated into English very well. All the people seem like &quot;caricatures&quot;, flat and unlikable. However, the show rounds them out and makes the books make more sense. Ciri  in the books is absolutely unbearable and bratty, the show gives her more depth and vulnerability. The books/game makes  Yennifer an insufferable BITCH, the show makes you actually care about and understand how and why she is so driven. The actress who plays her is wonderful. The books are really about Ciri even though they are called The Witcher. Geralt just happens to be a better character than Ciri. I think the author wanted an older audience for the sex. If you said Ciri was the main charter, a child, you couldn&#39;t have all the sex. Incidentally, for the time line in the books Ciri should end up like 25, for all her life experience, but she&#39;s 15-ish which is ridiculous. Maybe the show will make it work. The author should be thrilled someone took his crappy idea and made it cool.
Damn it Jeremy...  Why don&#39;t you have any wrinkles... <br><br>Still love you
You spoke my thoughts lol
Dude actually made a pitchfork joke without realizing it. Lol. Jeremy is awesome.
Flaw of time jumping around is because producers of the show did best thing they could: they started with short stories of Geralt and kind of combined them to make a background.<br><br>Now, when show was well received, they&#39;ve got 7 books of epic saga with hopefully bigger budget to run with.
Jeremy, it is your type of game! Please play it on twitch for us :)
‚ô™Toss a coin to your Witcher, a review from Jeremy, a review from Jeremy‚ô™
I felt like Yennefer‚Äôs story wasnt going anywhere honestly... At first she had my curiosity, but I got bored fast. Like Jeremy I am a new comer to this series but Geralt is The man!
Sure Yenifer has a good idea and meaning, but like her fuckin&#39; story went by so fast. &quot;oh we purchased you, now your a wizard.&quot; Like seriously... the show did this for like everything, the witcher thing really had the best entertainment value, whereas the little girl had the best story parts. Everything was out of sync, like it was awful. . . though I guess the book is like that too, but just because its that way somewhere else doesn&#39;t mean its good.<br><br>Show was pretty garbage, but overall enjoyable. . . so I have a love/hate relationship with it.
plenty of verbal clues that set a solid time frame in the show...just have to pay attention and then it becomes one of the shows greatest strengths in not having such a linear story line.
FR that passage of time fucked me. Biggest flaw if anything because it&#39;s not like they had any deaging effects to make it clear.
Jeremy, please please please read Stormbringer.. this is the book that inspired/influenced Legacy of Kain&#39;s Kain (white haired vampire with a soul eating sword), Warcraft&#39;s Arthas (white haired prince with a soul eating sword), the Witcher&#39;s Gerald (the white wolf), and many more.<br>The ending of soul reaver 2 is also greatly inspired by Stormbringer&#39;s ending.<br>The themes of free will, fate, balance, all began from this book. <br>Once you&#39;ve read it, it will blow your mind!
Not gonna comment on how fucking spot on Henry is to the actual character?<br>I&#39;m starting to think they designed the game character <b>knowing</b> the series was coming and aiming for Cavill.
In a way, I‚Äôm glad that Jeremy didn‚Äôt play the games, because he judge the show as it‚Äôs own thing, as it is. On the other hand, I played all the games, read two Witcher books and for me the show was disappointing. In games, Geralt has much more charm, much more irony, he is a more complex and better constructed character. In the books, there is much lore and specific Central European mythology which the Netflix show uninspired left behind, aiming to be a more universal, generic fantasy.
If you&#39;re interested in playing the games I would recommend starting with The Witcher 2, then playing The Witcher 3. The Witcher 1 is really hard to get into, its really dated.
The show is a great prelude to various things seen in the Witcher games. As someone who has only played 3 and in the process of playing 2, there were many parts where I was like, &quot;Oh, I remember that coming to a peak in game 3 or something&#39;. Like the Djinn. That was a singular moment for me as the conclusion for that happens in the games as far as I know, ignorant of the books just so you all know (not sure if that was also shown in the books). So of you watch one, you&#39;ll enjoy the other more. That&#39;s how I feel at least as a filthy filthy non-book reader. XD
So fair enough that Jeremy likes Yennefer, but I feel that Henry&#39;s acting made the show (for me). He portrays Geralt so good it&#39;s literally on the same level as Pheonix portraying Joker.
I liked the show and the games. But god i just want someone to acknowledge that the show is sooooo cheesy at times and not bad writing but inconsistent for sure.
I‚Äôve never played the games either, but I don‚Äôt think Yennifer was THAT great. The actress kinda irritated me. Either way, the MESSAGE of Yennifer‚Äôs story was definitely intriguing and I agree with what you said.
I&#39;ve been rewatching and if u pay attention they drop little things which tells you the time difference like when they mention at the party  that the queen of cintra won her first battle when she was as old as ciri. Then later when watching Geralt someone mentions that she had just won her 1st battle.
My only problem was the time line hopping . But I managed to figure it out eventually <br><br>Might start reading the books one day . I did play W1 but my save got lost . But I played W3 fully and loved it one of my favorite RPGs open world
Its made for rewatching. i havent finished the games never read the book but i got the story on multiple viewings.
how do you like that silver?
The Witcher isn‚Äôt so great. Some parts are boring. In the fightscenes sometimes they use piwer sometimes not. The Dragon fight was so stupid, a construct and unbelievable.<br><br>The main characters are great. Sone storyparts are boring.
Dude you just said everything I wanna say about this show!
Everyone: &#39;Picks up pitchforks&#39; ........&quot;PLAY THE GAMES JEREMY!&quot;
People are mostly angry about the timeline changes and the decision to bring Ciri in early. I‚Äôve read all the books and I quite liked that change. Establishing her from the very beginning gives viewers more time to forge a connection with her. If they were to introduce her in later seasons then quickly move her plot along, I feel like people wouldn‚Äôt care as much. We‚Äôll get to see her grow up and mature with every season, much like Arya in GoT.
Where is Jaskier?
What I didn&#39;t understand was why Geralt demanded the law of surprise during the moment when Pavetta&#39;s lover asked that how can he pay the debt?
Games are much much better. Series is bland. I waiting for full frame movie from Peter Jackson behind camera :)
Not gonna lie this show sucks lol
&quot;Of the 3 characters&quot; <br><br><br>Jaskier is hurt right now...
Watched the first 4 episodes and never got into it. Can see how people really like it though. Will try again with season two
How bout play the fucking game
Loved it!
I like me some Cahir. He&#39;s a super badass and compelling antagonist, without knowing anything about him really. <br><br>Cirilla&#39;s dad, also a badass
Jeremy Leather armour +15<br>Attacking fans damage +568<br><br><br><br>....hmmmm.....fuck.
The games are sequels to the books.
They tell you lines that reference time every episode. You just have to pay attention.
&quot;Toss a coin to your witcher, oh valley of plenty, oh valley of plenty. Toss a coin a to your witcher, oh valley of plenty.&quot;<br>I can not get that song out of my head now!!
Yeah as someone not knowing the lore at all the first three episodes were so confusing with the passage of time but once you get to the fourth episode i think it was it suddenly all clicks together
Boring overhyped Netflix produced horse crap.
Haven&#39;t played the game but always wanted to, loved the first season though!
Please play the games only 2 and 3
There is a game about wwi called Valiant Hearts that is totally worth a play if you&#39;re into gaming. Came out in 2014 and my bf and I went through it together. (he played I watched) I believe Ubisoft made it.
Yeah, but Yennefer was way better and had way more character before she turned beautiful!<br>I think the series was enjoyable, but there were sooo many &quot;why the hell&quot;-moments... Unfortunately :/<br>Looking forward to season 2 in 2021(???) though
I like the review but I cant believe you didn&#39;t even touch on Jaskier!!
HATEFUL COMMENTS!!
dr dolittle!
It‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs no game of thrones. That last episode was kind of bad. The writing is bad in the last episode and Yennifer‚Äôs motivation throughout the season is dumb. She was told what the transformation would do to her and now she wants to go against it. The bard guy was annoying. His accent was crap and waived at times so I was taken out of the show every time he was on screen. If you remove him out of the show, it continues great without him.
When eventually you do play the witcher 3 : wild hunt, don&#39;t be shy to review it, because it&#39;s just that great. My favourite game of all time
Don&#39;t worry Jeremy, you aren&#39;t the only one who hasn&#39;t played the games. I didn&#39;t play then till recently, and while I loved the story, I hated the combat. Couldn&#39;t continue it, so I&#39;ll just watch the series.

Witcher 3:Wild hunt Aka The Goat
Can you review You season 2 please!
The show is good but not great... (in my opinion!). The books, however, are phenomenal. I just started reading them last week and I&#39;m already on book 3 (of 8). I highly recommend them.<br><br>There is so much to love about the show - the casting, the fight choreography, set design, production quality, SFx, etc - but for me there are a few issues that make me concerned about its future, bearing in mind what happened to Game of Thrones. Basically, it boils down to the way they&#39;ve told the story. As much as I love Yennefer, (Anya Chalotra is amazing!), why do we get her backstory, her character arc, and end with her epic conclusion, while Geralt gets none of this? I mean, the show is called &#39;the Witcher&#39;, so why is he lying in a cart for the entire final episode while her conflict steals the show? They&#39;ve also taken away so much of the mystery, intrigue, and plot twists of the books to replace it with heavy-handed dialogue that they repeat over and over (instead of letting us discover for ourselves). And you can&#39;t say it was to simplify the story for a different media, because they&#39;ve actually made it far more convoluted with all the jumping timelines and filler material. In summary, it&#39;s poorly told, and the stand out parts of the story are the ones that remained faithful to the source. This concerns me about what other liberties they&#39;re planning on taking.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m all for changes... as long as those changes are necessary to tell a good story in a different medium, not just because someone wants to experiment with someone else&#39;s masterpiece.
If you really like great story- telling in your games Jeremy, you&#39;ll likely enjoy the Witcher 3. If you care less about stories and more about great gameplay (like me) then the Witcher games are dog shit.<br><br>Seriously. The controls and combat fucking suck. So many people calling Witcher 3 game of the decade and I can&#39;t stomach how shitty the game feels.
‚ÄúIve never played-‚Äú<br><br>WHAT?!!!!! <b>grabs pitchfork</b><br><br>‚ÄúPut away your pitchforks-<br>The Witcher games‚Äù<br><br><b>puts away pitchfork. Grabs a fucking shotgun</b>
What. You never played the Witcher games. It‚Äôs over Jermey. We are done. Jk. Love ur content and they way you review. Keep up the good work.
Just an opinion regarding playing the games. I&#39;d honestly say start with the 2nd if you want to get a smaller taste of the Witcher world and then indulge in the epic that is Witcher 3. The first game has a good story, however, CDProject Red created the game without understanding they needed to put in safeguards to keep people from causing NPC&#39;s to either hate you too much or for you to kill NPC&#39;s prior to critical points in the story progression. This being significant because the first game is set episodically and you can very easily lock yourself into a chapter. The second game is much better and fixes that issue, but in truth, I find the graphics and textures, especially in the well lite scenes to be a little garish and overbearing.
surprised you didn‚Äôt mention ‚ÄúToss a coin to your witcher...... ‚Äú that shit slaps
Jessu, I looked up at a your hair and now I can&#39;t take my eyes off of it.
I&#39;d give Witcher 2 and 3 a try, from what I remember getting into the first one was kinda, annoying.
Nice review
Jeremy looks like a guy who would love the Witcher 3. Jeremy if you read this don‚Äôt bother with the Witcher 1 and 2. Just please play The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and then the expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood &amp; Wine. Trust me you will not be disappointed.
I actually find jeremys perspective interesing. A guy who hasnt played the games and just watch the series? It is quite refreshing to see.
Ooooowh now I get it! You have been blinded by laziness all these years. Now would you be so kind please, to review The Witcher Wild Hunt with all it&#39;s DLCs and both expansions? If you give it a speed run without sleeping, you could finish them in about 100 hours minimum.
No Jaskier mentioned?<br>But why?
If you wanna get that Game of Thrones fix for its sense of political intrigue, strong characters, brutal fights, and fascinating story rather than the whole fantasy element I&#39;d highly recommend Black Sails.
&quot;Boo hoo, I&#39;m so pretty, pity me.&quot;
Timeline questions. Episode 7. That is all. Dont think i&#39;ve seen a series first outgoing season have such an impactful episode lore and tie-in wise than that one. It was almost like a &quot; We probably should of had 12-16 episodes this seaso to flesh out, but were gonna use this episode to mindfuck and also tie some shit you were questioning up to speed.
So basically ur saying Henry is a ultimate Chad
His reaction when he saw that good dragon was hilarious.
Ignore the haters on this review Jeremy. You did it justice even without playing the games or reading the books. Having played the games and read the books you definitely were on point.
&quot;Mmmmmm.... ffffffffuq&quot; cause he&#39;s a snack
I got so excited the first time he used Aard in that fight in bleviken. I was like YES!! Then every time he goes &quot;hmm&quot; I smile thinking of the video game Geralt..
It is very jumpy. It jumps from past to future and doesn&#39;t give you any clue to when they are.
You haven‚Äôt played the Witcher game?!!<br><br>Geralt: hmmm
Getting a wolverine vibe from jeremy
Oh no. You didn&#39;t play the witcher?  Be gone!
7.5/10 fun
YoU hAvEnT pLaYeD tHe WiTcHeR gAmEs!<br><br>neither have I
Haven&#39;t played the games, but definitely looking forward to the next season. Yenefer is my fave and I was a little distracted to care about the timeline at the end. That won&#39;t work all the time. It felt like cheating, by withholding parts of the same scene when the scene is supposed to be the exact same just different context.
Finally!!!! I was waiting for this one!
Fucking finally.
&quot;Mmmm&quot;<br>- Geralt
There are 2 different timelines and the way is handled not clear at all
the funny thing is Geralt once told his friend he got stabbed by a pitchfork in the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt üòÇ so I thought you were referencing that
How could you not mention Jaskier?! He made this show
It&#39;s a 5 out of 10 show with potential to be better.
Ummmmm ffuucckk<br>Is it no alcohol required?
Omg!!! You haven&#39;t whaaaAaaAAat!?!?!?!
No offense Henry, you‚Äôre still a snack!!<br><br>‚ÄîJeremy J.
Yennefer says it&#39;s been 30 years since her transformation.
Yennefer is the best character in this show.
I&#39;ve read the books and the games(especially The Witcher 3) and I adore them. I&#39;ve been keeping away from the show, but I think you&#39;ve convinced me to start watching it.
Idk, but I felt a bit claustrophobic with the cinematography. Some shots were far too close and compact for my taste and that made it hard to watch for me
Never played the game. But, i am always up for some new cool looking series. The Witcher did not disappoint. My favorite character is Queen Calanthe.
100% agree with you. I really enjoyed the first season
Haven&#39;t played the games? Do you know how many people who would like to trade places with you? To enjoy them for the first time all over again?
I&#39;m so happy that you talked about the pacing, and how off it was. Most of your fans have probably read the series before, so they probably had a fairly easy time following along. I haven&#39;t; the only thing that got me past episode one was that I&#39;d played and enjoyed the games.<br><br> The first 3 episodes were extremely confusing for me, because of how jumpy the timeline of the show was. Even knowing that it was skipping around, I still struggled with specific characters and moments within the show simply because there was no indication of a time skip. After I realized what was going on I was fine with it, but before that point I wasn&#39;t feeling the show at all.
Played the games, binged all three in about a month. Got very attached to the characters and had some serious post witcher depression. I thought the show was great. I agree that the time jumps were confusing at first but once you get into the swing of things it&#39;s so fun and engaging. Great cast, great action. Very excited for season 2
This season was just mediocre.
The games actually take place AFTER the novels !!!<br>Read them... Play the game ... Do a review ! ;)
If you ever have the time definitely play the games jeremy
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m54s"">3:54</a> right like the actress played Ciri great imo and if she grows with this role she‚Äôll easily be one of the best but man the writers need to do more with her
Finally someone else who didn&#39;t like the first episode !!
Witcher game was boring. Then Again... once you go Dark Souls. Most games are.
He got on board as soon as Toss a Coin to Your Witcher was sung.
Neither did I but I loved it
You haven&#39;t played the witcher games <br><br>REEEEEEEEEEEE
Wasn&#39;t a fan of Geralt being poisoned hence sidelined for the big finale. But.... I get it?
Hmmmmmmmm fuck....
Toss a like to your witcher
i agree...the voice took a moment, the switching timelines took a second, but in the end, me likie.  as for GoT not even looking like the same planet IMO and didn&#39;t expect it to, though i&#39;ve read all those books, so now reading the Witcher series, which i&#39;d put off for some time (like Hyperion). this is a much darker set of characters and the action is much more frequent. waiting for season 2.
Holy Fuck! Did you hold back on this one! (Give the people what they want i guess?!) This was shit! But because people say its good, its good? <br>Lol, I&#39;d watch it again because its my jam but everything was choppy as hell! Story line, time line, character arcs, graphics, writing!.. all shit! I shouldn&#39;t have to read the books to fully chill in this universe, that&#39;s what story adaptation is for. It&#39;s like George Martin or Peter Jackson directed a episode for the sundance festival. <br>Good series doe
Actually Ciri it&#39;s a really important character she&#39;s Gerald and yennefer adoptive daughter and she becomes a Witcher too. I like this show more than game of thrones from the beginning to be honest, hopefully they don&#39;t ruinned like game of thrones at the end
His voice is annoying in the show
The ONLY GOT fix available on Netflix is MARCO POLO which ironically was overlooked because of GOT. <br>Hunger Games+Twilight = the Witcher <br>But if you like extra cheez then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The Witcher season 1 Soap opera trash there  end of review.
I can‚Äôt be the only 1 that finds the dialogue is pretty trash tbh
Honestly this just confirms that they took influence from the games as much as the books. Cause a lot of the time I was thinking to myself &quot;This is just like the game this is just like the game.&quot;
&quot;well, not really a conspiracy ... there were some tweets.&quot;     perfect.  I enjoyred it so much I watched it twice.
You haven‚Äôt played the games?! Gimme my pitchy!
As someone who has played the games AND read the books, the Netflix adaptation fully disappointed me. It wasn&#39;t BAD, it just wasn&#39;t the orgasm everyone is creaming themselves over. I strongly urge anyone that has seen the show and liked it but has never read the books and/or never played the games (or, at the very least, the first two games) to read the books and, at the very least, watch playthroughs of the first two games. All of which are better than the show. That being said, I am looking forward to when the show delves into the 5-part saga. I felt they rushed many of the short stories that were adapted from the books, but if they slow the pacing down, I feel it&#39;ll improve.
you haven&#39;t played witcher 3?OMG GO AND PLAY IT NOW!
Yes, Yennifer hands down my favorite üôåüèº
Started playing the first Witcher game because of the series and it holds up! Worth a play if you‚Äôre into gaming at all.
don&#39;t play the games. they are large spoiled for the serie
Now do HBOs Watchmen.
‚ÄúStuff takes time‚Äù<br><br>Jeremy binge watches all Witcher episodes in 1 day
You don‚Äôt have to play the games to enjoy the show but his voice is from the games
Not only did Henry Cavill take that roll because he likes the games. He BEGGED Netflix every day (before they even had a script) until they said yes for that role.
Some lore for you Jeremy. Witchers are basically regular humans who&#39;ve been put through this really painful mutation ritual that kills most people but the survivors end up really strong and have a few other powers. So they use orphans for that. Anyway, the witchers are monster hunters who kill monsters for money. They&#39;re also infertile so they sleep around a lot. <br><br>In the books Geralt is one of the last witchers and the practice of &quot;creating&quot; witchers has died with his mentors.
Witcher 3 Wildhunt and it‚Äôs DLC has got to be the best game of all time for many people. Buy it dude. You don‚Äôt even need to play the first two games.
More Witcher less Yennefer.<br>I have spoken.
Btw- I think it‚Äôs pretty clear as a fan of the games he‚Äôs definitely throwing a bone to Doug Cockle who is the voice of Geralt in games and I fucking love it. I think it‚Äôll get better and more natural as he continues to work.
The similarities between the Witcher and the Mandalorian, coincidence?
It‚Äôs been my favourite thing since I snuck the books as a kid and I‚Äôm so fucking happy other people are falling in love with it too. Can‚Äôt wait for Regis. üç∑ üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Do a titans season 2 review!
that pitchfork joke, damnit jeremy
neither have i and i tried and the movement is terrible
TL;DR of what a Witcher really is Jeremy:<br><br>They&#39;re basically medieval Jedis.
Hmmmm fuuuckk......
Jeremy, I&#39;ve need a Game of Thrones fix since the end of Game of Thrones season 7!
I thought Henry Cavill looked kinda goofy in the costume
Fuck GOT, witcher books are better.
I am not over how bad Henry&#39;s wig looks
Yennefer hmmmmm fuck
I thought this show was pretty cool, didn&#39;t read the books or play the games, but it was pretty awesome!!
Am I the only one who thought Yennifer was hot before she got un hunchbacked? No, just me...
I own all three games and haven&#39;t played them. Idk I know I&#39;ll love them, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to dive in.
Seems like Jeremy was tiptoeing around the Witcher fans with this review.
Hey Jeremy, I have many good 2019 films to recommend to you so that you don&#39;t look like a dumb-head mainstream teenage cinemagoer: Parasite, The Lighthouse, Shadow, The Farewell, Jojo Rabbit, Marriage Story
That&#39;s alright Jeremy I haven&#39;t played the witches games eather. Well ok I played the first one a bit...I died...a lot...like a lot a lot
Talk about dragon
Well, since we&#39;re in the Netflix, Series reviewing topic. Can you please review &quot;You&quot; Season 1 - Season 2?
COME ON, JEREMY! Do Marriage Story, why don&#39;t you?
you&#39;re good Jeremy you don&#39;t have too play the games bro but playing the the witcher 3 could be something you can do on your free time if you want
‚ÄúWinds howling‚Äù
I&#39;m happy you liked it, Jeremy! I played Witcher 3 a couple years ago and loved it. For me, Breath of the Wild is the only other fantasy adventure game in the last decade I thought stacked up! Witcher 3 also has the best side quests in video game history. So I strongly recommend it if you can find time!<br><br>After playing Witcher 3 I listened to all the audio books of the novels and loved them too! I especially loved the short stories that made up the first two books which really lend themselves to quests or... episodes! So while I could talk for days about this franchise, as a fan of the games and books I give season 1 an 8/10 and think it is a great start to a series that has room to get even better!
Please do Dracula next üòçüòçüòç <br>Dracula Netflix
I be in the club like..&quot;Toss a coin to your witcher oh i valley of plenty&quot;üò´üòú
The scene where Yennefer is next to that baby on the beach, and the accompanying dialogue broke my heart.
The swearing ruined the fantasy world.
Star Wars and Game of Thrones fan and you don&#39;t even mention the sword fighting...
Neither did I read or play. The games suck and the books are boring. This is very good though
GoT comparisons really need to stop. <br>Just my opinion, but it‚Äôs lazy.
Is this a cry for help Jeremy? You need to talk about it?
Never really played the game either(Started Withcer 3 but just ended playing gwent for like 10 hours). But the show really clicked for especially the way they structured the story. Know some people had problems with it , but in my brain it flowed well.
No mention of Jaskier.........
Jahns. Do yourself a favor and play the games, especially The Witcher 3. It&#39;s far better than any of the ones you&#39;ve reviewed on your channel. üëç
I think i actually liked how they did the timeline. Each story was told separate and eventually caught up with each other. I admit i was a bit lost at 1 point but then i figured it out. And i appreciated the fact the they didnt just do the regular thing and wrote &quot;10 years later&quot; or &quot;present day&quot; at the bottom of the screen.
I couldn‚Äôt get through the whole show, it was just so boring and the exposition just gave me a headache. Yennefer had the most compelling storyline but everything else was exhausting to follow. I might give it another shot before season 2 comes out.
I walked away from Yennifer&#39;s story realizing she blamed the covenant for her magical hysterectomy but she was given an opportunity to decide several times if this is what you want and she took it because of her drive for beauty and the need to be an influencer over her kingdom. She&#39;s ultimately the maker of her own bed and failed to own up to it... or sloppy writing tried pull an old Jedi trick as if we didn&#39;t remember. Well I did...
@Jeremy Jahns  You haven&#39;t played the Witcher 3?  It&#39;s a masterpiece of a video game, I couldn&#39;t recommend it more.  When you play it, you&#39;ll realize why everyone is so hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. üòé
For me season one was a 7/10.
Play RDR2 pleaseeeee
Toss a coin to your Jeremy, reviewer of plenty, oh-oh.
Untz untz untz
Same here..haven&#39;t played the game or read the book either..went in as a fantasy series fan..great characters, saw boobies, good times no alcohol required..
Never read the books, never played the games, and absolutely loved the show.<br>The fact that they just dropped us (the audience) in the middle of it and let us figure out on our own what was going on is one of my favorite things about it!
This show has a  lot of potential.
&quot;Beauty and Power isn&#39;t everything.&quot; Says the good looking YouTube Star.
I‚Äôm curious to see what you think of the BBC Dracula show
Man Jeremy you are missing out! Here&#39;s a tip. You don&#39;t need to play the first two games. Dont miss out on the experience that is the Witcher 3 because you haven&#39;t played the previous two. It will be worth it.
Honestly I was hoping you hadn&#39;t played the game so that you wouldn&#39;t have trouble judging it on if it can stand under its own weight.
What i take away from this review is: they made triss so irrelevant that to someone who hasn&#39;t played the games she doesn&#39;t matter at all. Also that casting choice... yikes.
I don&#39;t care if you haven&#39;t played the games. I&#39;m just disappointed that you didn&#39;t mention reading the books.
I will buy you Witcher 3 just so you can enjoy it and understand the great work CD Projekt Red did.   hit me up
I didnt enjoy the show. The pacing was awful. Some of the acting was cringey on the other characters. The character development felt rushed and I didnt care for any of them. (Good character development imo has you connecting with a character&#39;s journey). One episode Yennefer is a helpless little loser, the next episode she&#39;s a total badass. It just felt so disjointed. Final battle was kinda cool. That&#39;s about it. Will I keep watching? Yeah probably lol
Love all your reviews,, but cant  help but notice in this one more then others your starting to pull off the Ruby Rod hair style from chris rock in the 5th element,,lol
Great review, but one issue (and I&#39;ve had this issue with pretty much EVERY review of The Witcher)<br><br><br>Why does everyone need timelines spoon-fed to them? Especially when the story being told places no importance on &quot;how long has it been since X/Y/Z?&quot;. Season 1 was essentially a collection of short stories, the passage of time and the relation of Geralt&#39;s timeline vs. Yen&#39;s timeline vs. Ciri&#39;s timeline really do not matter. And when the timelines DO matter, the show explains it and brings it all together.
I agree totally Jeremy. The different timelines are disorientating, and Ciri&#39;s escape from Cintra was the least interesting arc.<br>Which is a problem, since that&#39;s the main plotline of the books. Now that they&#39;ve covered the background for Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer I hope that Season 2 will shape up.
Gonna be honest. The Witcher season 1 felt a lot like season 1 of Game Of Thrones to me. It&#39;s weird, time seems to fast forward and characters die without me caring why. But I feel like as time passes and we get to like season 3 or 4 the first season will make more sense and actually become super important due to the forshadowing that they drop into it without us realizing it right now.
Henrys voice was my favourite part of him as Geralt
Review MORBIUS pls.....
I&#39;m glad that they made Yennefer more likeable. I kinda hated her in the books.<br><br><br>I highly recommend the book series. They are my current favorite books.
I fucking loved every minute
Only played the Intro to the 2nd game, never read the books. ... Didn&#39;t know the books EXISTED till just before this series came out. Never seen a single episode of Game Of Thrones either, so not spoiled there. <br><br><br>Annnnnnndd. THIS SHOW HAS ME HOOKED! <br>It&#39;s a slow burn show for the first half, but on rewatching it slowly and consistently ramps up episode by episode, till the very end i was sitting on the edge of my seat. <br><br>Very Well Done! <br>Now if we can only find some one who knows how to write a good Superman Story for Henry, we&#39;d be set.
This series was as good as I hoped it would be. Cavill killed it as Geralt. <br>A coin for this review.
To be honest, I think the show was pretty average. <br><br>For example the plot is really weak in my opinion, the only thing moving it forward is ‚ÄúDESTINY.‚Äù I think it would‚Äôve been far more interesting if they had the main plot of season 1 be Geralt searching for this one monster that either killed someone he cares for or has been causing mass destruction on the continent. That way we get all these interesting sub plots of him fighting the different monsters and meeting the main characters, because he‚Äôs ultimately trying to just find this 1 monster. (FYI I haven&#39;t read the books, only played The Witcher 3) <br><br>I believe they should‚Äôve left Nilfgaard &amp; Ciri for the next season or at least have them introduced in the last episode. Nilfgaard attacking Cintra in the first episode had no emotional weight to it, neither was it a particularly exciting battle, and having it come full circle in the last episode felt pointless. Also, have the season span across only a month in real time, rather than like 20 years with no clear indication of time jumps. <br><br>Apart from that I liked the casting of the main characters and thought the monster designs and set/costume designs were awesome.
i loved watching this series but I did feel that this 1st season of witcher was more about yennefer then gerlt, yennefer was the character I connected with the most &amp; the characters was very likeable but I felt like the pacing was off a little and there was some costume flaws as well because there was armour that was black and crinkled &amp; excuse my language but they looked like crinkled up balls rather then soulders ü§£ü§£.  I do think that one who played the witcher did an amazing job &amp; gave very high sex appeal to this role so I got a man crush on him ,but I have read the books so i know what was going on &amp; season 1 was based on the short stories that where done that&#39;s why each episode had different time lines. I am very excited for season 2 that should be starting on the book the last wish thats the 1st in the series to start it off properly <br><br>Great review üòä‚ù§ü§óüëç
The points i dislike that i remember from it<br>-geralt and yen relationship is kind of blurry, like how the fuck geralt gets so attached that much suddenly, like wherever yen is i&#39;m in, why? How?<br>- they mentioned moussack is a druid only once and that&#39;s only from jaskier<br>- the yen bit is somehow also confusing, like why did she smiles after her friends gets turned into a fucking fish? After like stopping her teacher to do so, she&#39;s like &quot;i&#39;m fine with that :)&quot; why? Also why she wants to have a kid so suddenly?
I definitely have some issues in it. I&#39;m not a fan of some of the casting of some of the supporting characters, and although I get what they were going for, I didn&#39;t think they did as well as they could have when it came to jumping back and forth through time. They said they were inspired to do it the way they did by Dunkirk, and I don&#39;t think even that did constant time-jumping extremely well. Beyond that, I thought it was a really fun.m watch. I don&#39;t like the idea of people saying it&#39;s trying to be a Game of Thrones replacement, because then people will try to measure it in comparison to that, for better and for worsr, instead of judging it on its own merits as kt&#39;s own thing. I will say though GOT took itself really seriously, to the point of being try-hard edgy at times, whereas The Witcher, although taking itself seriously, definitely wasn&#39;t afraid to also have fun. It knew when to play it serious, but it also knew when and how not to take itself too seriously. I&#39;ll quote another review I listened to on the show, &quot;it&#39;s not &quot;great&#39; art, but it&#39;s lots and lots of fun.&quot;
I ve played a few hours of the witcher 1, 2 and 3 and it could hook me. The show is good, maybe I&#39;ll get back to 3.
Yennefer is trying to save a baby and she gives a very cynical but powerful monologue at the end of the scene.That was The Witcher at it&#39;s best.Great show
It&#39;s very satisfying for fans of the games because some things happen you only hear off in the games and don&#39;t witness.
A question from people who have watched the show. Have they introduced Triss, if not than iam not watching it.
Ok people are making such a big deal about the timeline situation and I don&#39;t know why! I watched this show knowing absolutely NOTHING about it&#39;s history and by the end I pretty much had it.
I never finished playing Witcher 3, and it&#39;s the only one I&#39;ve played. I think they definitely nailed the tone and characters with the series. It&#39;s just as immersive and interesting.
Haven&#39;t played the games either.<br><br>Edit: yea, I was really confused with a lot of the time jumps at first. Was like, wait, isn&#39;t that person dead? Do they have a twin?? But once it clicked, I was hooked.<br><br>Makes me want to play the game but at the same time, I don&#39;t want any spoilers haha. And yes, I know it&#39;s not going to be the same but still.
It&#39;s probably best that you haven&#39;t played any of the games or read the books. That way you have a fresh unbiased take on the show.
the series was decent, as above Yennefer&#39;s arc was the best and most fleshed out, Geralt was nailed in by Cavill and Ciri will get more later. But forced , inorganic diversity choices was just grating.
Jeremy: I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games<br><br>Me: <b>Hmm</b> ... Fuck
I&#39;m only played maybe 40 ish hours of Witcher 3 and dabbled in Witcher 1, but yeah, that voice sounds spot on.
The show made you investigate... Just like a witcher :D
Witchers are judged too :D
It will be a year to season 2. Please play the games :D PLEEEEAAASSSSEEEE!!!!
I wanted to play the games but never got around to it. I knew very little about the characters, I knew his name is geralt and he hunts monsters ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.  The show was pretty good, the effects are done fairly well; the sets are very nice but occasionally the monsters look a bit wonky (looking at you dragon). The story was pretty good, it was a bit confusing at first but by the 4th or 5th episode when I figured out we were watching multiple timelines, it was much easier to follow.  To be honest, some of the early stuff with the character yennifer had a hard time keeping my attention but it got more interesting as the character grew. I can tell the bard is probably a fan favorite character and I am certain they loved him but lets just say I didn&#39;t miss him when he wasn&#39;t around. Henry Cavill was good in the role of geralt, there were a few times when something (it varied) would break the immersion and I could see superman shine through but for the most part he disappeared into the character which is what I want from an actor. The kid was good, better than most of the other actors in her section of the story. Not sure if it was the writing, direction or acting but some of the side characters occasionally felt a out of place and were a little over the top and a bit campy at times but pretty good overall.<br>I like where it took us, even if I don&#39;t love where they left us; at the end I was like &quot;ok this is really getting good, can&#39;t wait to see the next... wait, that was the last episode, sonova...&quot;. Overall I enjoyed the show and look forward to next season.
You made it through the whole review and didn&#39;t toss a coin to your Witcher. Surprising
Witcher 3 isn‚Äôt just the best game of the decade.. it‚Äôs the best game of all time
I‚Äôm waiting on your thoughts for that Morbius trailer ... üëÄ
If you haven‚Äôt watched this show.. WATCH IT
Loved how they played with the timeline
Disagree.
I‚Äôm happy they focused on books not games
I completely agree.  It was entertaining, and the characters grew on me.  (The actors were all phenomenal).  The worldbuilding could use some work - since most viewers HAVEN&#39;T read the books.  The continuity was...not great.  And the princess&#39;s arc was totally boring and kind of irrelevant.  But I&#39;m curious to see where it goes.
Cough* Vinland Saga!
Spoiler<br><br><br>After a while, Yennefer got really to me and just seemed like an angsty Emo the whole show , plus the whole thing with the powers of mages are unclear. Like I though the end siege was cool ,but kinda stupid because of how it felt like many of the mages were just throwing themselves at the soldiers instead of say, retreating and fighting again.
Having only played the games I&#39;m finding the series interesting because the events are things that are only alluded to as things that happened. The jumping around in time didn&#39;t really work, but I believe the books do it too. Still, could have been better executed. Definitely hyped to see a season 2, I hope it gets made if it hasn&#39;t been already.
I haven&#39;t played The Witcher games either should I play them ?
Learning that Henry cavill is a game nerd makes me love this show even more. ‚ù§
If you played the games you would understand where Cavill decided to go for this style.
Given that you&#39;re a video game fanatic I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t played the games. I think you will like Witcher 3 in particular.
Near I heard tell, Cavill PUSHED to get the role because he loved the game that much.  He kept bugging his agent to keep asking about the role until he got it üòÜ
Buy on 4k?
I.... never played them either. I prefer FPSs myself. Or Kirby. Or Batman.
I played all three Witcher games and consider the third to be one of the best around, but I just couldn&#39;t get into the show.
&quot;Don&#39;t know if leather stops pitchforks.&quot; Oh the irony üòè
Fuck anyone who plays witcher
Jeremy please watch and review the lighthouse!
Pleeaseee review TOGOOO
Pleeaseee review TOGOOO
WATCH MR ROBOT PLS, DONT DO IT FOR ME DO IT FOR YOURSELF
Well executed, entertaining show that I absolutely loved. The time skipping didn&#39;t bother considering.<br>I mean we complain about shows baby  us thinking we are stupid, and it certainly makes it re watchable adding a layer of depth.<br>Besides, I came to the series as a game fan, later reading the source,    I knew immediately the game developers made something quite awesome (frankly to me the games are better), this tv series explains in no uncertain terms that its based on the books first (short episodic tales in different order) so this didn&#39;t come as a surprise and I simply loved it.
This show is a piece of shit.  The acting and dialogue is terrible.  That was apparent within the first 5 minutes, and it was enough for me to stop watching.
You NEED to talk about the Morbius trailet
also never played the game... but i know of SFM fanart online...
I&#39;ll wait for Wheel of Time and LOTR :)
It&#39;s okay, Jeremy. I also haven&#39;t played the games. <br><br>Don&#39;t worry bb
Yeah I did not love this show. It was ok but ultimately it was a huge narrative mess.
Yet another comapring to got, i love got, but those 3 final season season , specially the 8 one is make me forget got even exist.
Witcher was disappointing. The story lacks focus and the narrative is needlessly jumbled and confusing. All the marketing was around Henry Cavill and his character isn&#39;t really that interesting and worst of all his character is mostly incapacitated in the last episode, the last fucking episode.
Jeremy you&#39;re who the shows primarily for, this is your introductions so they&#39;re hoping to make it cohesive enough to understand without prior knowledge
Imagine the series eventually ending with the worst witcher 3 ending. Man we will drown in tears...
Wait...No Jaskier?????
I&#39;d say I&#39;m half and half with this show. I like the world and Geralt doing things. And Jaskier is fun. But I&#39;m not into Yennefer or mage politics. I just found Yennefer insufferable. But its okay. If I can oogle at Geralt then its okay for other people to like and oogle at Yennefer. haha
üî±
WB: No Superman Geralt: Fuck
As someone who is familiar with the storyline here is some advice for anyone who is new to it. Yes the 1st season is great, and yes it‚Äôs hard to follow at points. Stick with it to the end and it all kinda blends into something awesome. the entire 1st is a giant setup for seasons to come, they basically took an entire season to introduce characters and storyline to everyone that‚Äôs new. Seasons 2 and so on will be when the real fun starts üòè
I agree with Jeremy, the Yennefer story is very deep and a best character arc in the season
Show was good but some of the casting was awful and there needed to be more Geralt doing Witcher stuff. Also stick to practical effects because god damn some of the CGI monsters were Syfy level bad.
You know in game of thrones, when Tyrion and Varys have that discussion about power, talking about a sellsword and the 3 &#39;rich ppl&#39;<br><br><br>Geralt is that sellsword.....
To be fair, you do need a lot of down time to play Witcher 3.
HMMMM
If you&#39;re not a gamer its no big deal not to have played any witcher games but if you are and you havent played Witcher 3 shame on you. Witcher 3 when it came out and hell even today is a how games should be made with love and respect for the Consumer.
Wa is ched the series. Loved it, so I&#39;m watching it a second time for all that I missed. Also got me so intrigued in the lore, that I HAD to get the Witcher 3, and am now starting to play through it! Perhaps I will listen to the books on Audible or something. But yeah, Yen, was also my favorite character, so complex!
the show combines story from the books with the looks from the game series<br><br>and i love it
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m00s"">3:00</a> just so you know jeremy... <br><br>In playing the games and reading the books..that&#39;s the theme you will see alot of...or we should see alot of; grey area in making choices, and not being too sure if the choice you made was the right one...
It fills the gap that Hercules and Xena left.
The Whitcher treats its viewers as if they are smart and can keep up, which is unusual for most shows lately. I really enjoyed it.
Never read the books or played the game... so I thought it was a good show based on no prior biases.
I&#39;ve heard this series kinda ruins Ciri and that would be very disappointing.
Henry Cavill wanted to star in ‚ÄòThe Witcher‚Äô so badly that he bugged Netflix until they said yes
You don&#39;t need to play the games to watch this. From what I was told the games come after the books.
A. Do you need to chat Jeremy?<br>B. Fair enough on the games. Recommend Wild Hunt though (&lt;15 bucks for W3 full collection).<br>C. Poor Jaskier..........<br><br>I feel like this needs an edit with thoughts or at least a pinned comment. &quot;Toss a Coin to your Witcher&quot;
It&#39;s Conan the Barbarian meets The Beastmaster in my opinion. Fun show huh?
Amazing, but Watchmen Review When
Thx‚úåüèæ
Hair style: the wolverine.
The story line was pretty jarring with the time skips between the characters. It was enough to give Albert Einstein whiplash.
Review watchmen season 1!
ENGAGE!
Saw 20 minutes of it and quit. So sick of this SJW wokeness (Go WAHMEN!), I had to stop. Plus all I see is superman in a cheap blonde wig sounding like Batman.
Please, for the love of all the Greek, Norse, Christian, Egyptian, Roman, Mayan, and Celtic gods, please go watch a Witcher 1 and 2 recap, and then buy Witcher 3 Game of the Year edition right now! As a long time fan of your channel, I can say with 100% certainty that you&#39;d love it, and right now you&#39;re just missing out on the awesomeness that is 2015&#39;s Witcher 3!<br><br>Pro tip, don&#39;t go too deep into crafting Witcher school gear until new game+. Only go up to about Enhanced level, because you&#39;d feel like you wasted your time finding and crafting all the parts of items like Mastercrafted and Grandmaster gear only for them to fall to the side because there&#39;s 50 more levels to go after the main story and expansions are finished, and having under leveled gear equipped isn&#39;t a good idea. Some really good armor for your first playthrough is the Skellige Armor Set DLC gear that can be bought at level 16 or 41. It&#39;s a free DLC so why not? :D
Yeah the games are based on the world not the story of the books
Btw, I still say Triss was miscast.<br><br><br>Actress that played Vesenna would have been perfect for her
Nch Nch Nch.
Haven&#39;t played the games myself.
Jeremy - &quot;I haven&#39;t pla-&quot;<br><br><br>Me - &quot;say sike right now!&quot;
If i had to summarize my opinion about the show as a longtime fan of the books I would say it&#39;s a &quot;Netflix adaptation&quot; at its worst. I could go on a long tangent describing all the flaws of this series, but instead I&#39;ll share with you some facts about the short stories that were the basis of this season, and are mostly lost in the show:<br>- many fans consider the short story collection (&quot;The Last Wish&quot; and &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;) as the best part of the whole saga<br>- the short stories in majority are reinterpretations of well known fairy tales and legends, eg. Renfri = Snow White, <br>- short stories are fully presented from the perspective of Geralt - Yennefer and Ciri only appear in some of the stories<br>- the backstories of the man characters are rarely expanded upon in the book series<br>- the best part part of Sapkowki&#39;s writing is the dialogue which at it&#39;s best can be both witty and thought provoking<br>- the magic system is completely different in the books - in some places more flexible, in others more restrictive (I could really expand on this point and say a thing or two about screenwriters&#39; ridiculous inventions such as ovaries beauty creme if somebody is interested)
yeah i know ya feeling .. some times u need to know its a show who thinks its better :P
As a fan of the games, I am a fan of the tv show. But I really want them to do some stuff that are happening in the games. I know the show is taking the books route but the games are not that far off.
Jeremy Jahns: &quot;...I haven&#39;t played the witcher&quot;<br>Internet: KILL IT! KILL IT WITH IGNI!!! üòÇü§£
Toss a coin to your witcher, oh valley of plenty, oh valley of plenty, oh-oh-oh
I have played all the games and read about 3/5 the books. It has been recreated with great accuracy and authenticity so far.<br><br>For the record Geralt is supposed to be a mutant molded by magic to be able to heal from crazy injury and utilize magical potions that would kill a normal man but magically enhances his abilities. <br><br>Geralt also is a man who presents himself as how the world sees him but deep down has a strong moral code and compass. This was shown to us many times and I loved that. So much better than the no hero GOT characters.<br><br>HC stole the show for me as I felt he played Geralt perfectly. You could tell he actually does have a love for the lore and characters. I was impressed and thankful for his performance. <br><br>No character in the show was bad, but I did feel that Triss wasn&#39;t cast well. In the games and books she has blazing red hair, not freckles and almost brown hair. But it&#39;s not like the actress did bad for how little we have seen so far of her, minor complaint.<br><br>I also enjoyed they had a few creature quests that were also related to the main storyline in some way. It may not seem evident now but give it time, its telling a story.<br><br>They portrayed the world well, with its bigotry and racism. The petty warring between factions and the bigger battles brewing (such as with nilfgard).
Did he just review the Witcher Season 1 without talking about ‚ÄúToss a coin to your Witcher‚Äù!?!?!?!? Not even a Jaskier shout out?! Jeremy, I‚Äôm ashamed....
Bro how can you review anything Witcher related without mentioning Jaskier üòî
Do you plan to do a spoiler review?
I really liked the show the more I watched it, and I liked that The Witcher was somewhat episodic and wasn&#39;t like watching one long movie. They have shit other than the main plot going on to keep things interesting.
morbious trailer review?
mate, what the fuck is going on with your Barnet? your hair....
The striga episode was the turning point for me. As someone who doesn‚Äôt know much about the Witcher did you find parts of it confusing? I‚Äôve had a few people ask me what the ‚Äúconjunction of spheres‚Äù is.
For people asking if the games are good, I talk about the story, characters, politics, and monsters. Oh yea, and stuffed unicorn sex. It&#39;s the last thing that usually gets people interested.
Hmnn Fuck
Witcher&#39;s are just super soldiers
Easily best episiodes were 2,3,4.. after that it kinda started to go hill for me. Not to bad level. But those three episodes specifically are GoT level of good in terms of quality then especially after 5 it was good but mostly no longer great. Imo
The Passage of Time thing was so true, whole time I just winging it whatever timeline they‚Äôre in until Jaskier makes that statement
Go play Witcher 3 bitch
Seriously dude, go play the Witcher 3 =)  I got 50 hrs into into it, but never actually beat it.  I think I may do that now because I loved the show and feel ashamed I never actually beat the game.  The choices in that game are agonizing.  There are no binary good/evil choices like in KOTOR/Mass Effect/Fable.  Everything is grey.  Many times, there is no good choice, which is just depressing, but that&#39;s kind of the point I guess.
Agreed with the Ciri arc comment, with it being &quot;away from the party&quot;
ironically, base on the books of an event readers will know. Pitchforks do NOT stop leather.
I never played the games.  I once had a roommate who did, so I knew about the Witcher... Well, I knew about Gwent.  Otherwise, I had little idea about the show.  Watched it all in one day, and I loved it.  But the timeline screwed with me a bit.
Review YOU
I think you&#39;ll really enjoy Witcher 3 based on your past game reviews and you don&#39;t need to play the rest to understand it.
‚ÄúAt a point the show just got me..‚Äù<br><br>Yeh, when Yennifer got her kit off.
Yeah, maybe if the characters aged in any way it would have made the passage of time better or more organic feeling. That was the worst aspect of the show for me.
The best episode was basically the 1st one, then it got worst.
Dude. Play the game.
Thats ok Jeremy, I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games either. I started it then I dropped it. Not because I didn&#39;t like it, just other things took priority. I do want to go play it soon though.<br><br>I liked the Witcher (and I was one of the skeptics). I am not a fan of Yennifer as a character, personally, but that could be just down to me not likely those types of characters in general. That type of character being too domineering and self-centered. I liked how they clued us in with the timeline, especially because in Westworld season 2 it was convoluted and the payoff happened episodes later which I&#39;ve forgotten what was going on by that stage, whereas for the Witcher it happened in the next scene because the idea is fresh in our minds still. Jaskier and Geralt is awesome. And I liked the humour.
I love jaskier, I&#39;ve seen ppl say they hate him cuz they think he&#39;s corny but I think he brings some well needed levity to the show and I love his dynamic with geralt (plus toss a coin to your witcher is GREAT)
Lol, it&#39;s as if you know about the pitchfork, Jeremy.
Thoughts on Morbius?
This shite was so average. People overhyped this tripe more than The Mandalorian
Was pretty mediocre really, especially terrible looking plastic armor for the nilfgaardians and the poor writing.
The witchers are mutated super human monster hunters.  People don‚Äôt like them because people don‚Äôt like what they don‚Äôt know.<br><br>I was skeptical of Henry Cavell at first.  But he pulled it off and now I am fully for him being Geralt
The timeline was busted. A lot of my friends know I&#39;m the &quot;witcher&quot; guy so they all came at me at different times and asked me what the fuck was up with the timeline. They were confused. I explained to them and they caught on, but that seems like a big over-site for the show to not have time stamps on the time jumps.. come on. It&#39;s not that hard. The wither 3 had them.. just sayin&#39;
The Witcher games are admittedly better then the show. Witcher 3 specifically being a 10/10 game one of the greatest RPGS ever made. That being said the show is very good but it&#39;s not a 10/10. I enjoyed it a lot it&#39;s like an 8 or a 9 for me.
Jeremy- I haven‚Äôt played the games<br>Me- this man hasn‚Äôt lived
Yenn is the worst thing in the show for me. Almost made me stop watching. &quot;I NEVER HAD A CHOICE!&quot; Mmmm you did tho...people warned you... &quot;YOU HAVE A CHILD&quot; mmmmmmm he really didn&#39;t want this pact child....Yenn did have everything, a man who loved her even with her deformity who wanted to be with her. Magical powers and a spot with a kingdom that was well respected. She just wanted me and got fucked because of her selfish demands. Womp womp.
You should watch jo jo rabbit
üëè PLAY üëè THE üëè GAMES üëè PLEASE üëè
I‚Äôm waiting for some Morbius talk now, especially after the last 5 seconds of that trailer
I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games either. My old computer wasn&#39;t good enough to run Witcher 3, and I just haven&#39;t got around to it yet sines I got my new computer.
Never played the games or read the books, but I feel like that made my enjoyment of the show better. Had no expectations to color my view of it.
The time jumps and not having a real sense of time passed is something the books its based on also suffer from, since the first couple books are collections of short stories, with no mention of how much time passed between the stories. The show could have attempted to fix that, but didn&#39;t.
I haven&#39;t played them either, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not alone.
Bro play the damn game atleast witcher 3 its all you need
For the love of God, play the games good sir.
could you review some of those apple tv+shows? maybe like the morning show or servant?
Don&#39;t compare it to GOT in it&#39;s prime....compare it to GOT season 1. they just laying the foundation.
TOSS A COIN TO YOUR WITCHER!
To me season one was the Geralt and Yenner show and I really wanted to see more Geralt hunting down monsters and showcasing more epic sword fights!
Anyone else notice Jeremy&#39;s hair looks like the Mellenium Falcon
My only problem with the show is the titties. They all are exactly the same. Copy paste to every broad lol.
who else liked cause jeremy called henry cavill a snack? üòÇ
if felt the same with ciri&#39;s storyline, but seeing what she went through made me root for her harder to find geralt. i replayed the scene of them meeting like 5 times over bc i was so relieved. i feel both perspectives need to have their screen time to really care about them.
...... Play The Witcher 3.... and review it. Please.
Clearly this Jeremy is a Doppler
‚ÄúHmm‚Äù<br>-Geralt of Rivia
Wanted to like it... but couldn&#39;t get into it.
Am I the only nitpicky one who feels like they ran out of budget midway and said, &quot;well, let&#39;s just give them shitty contacts&quot;? Why couldn&#39;t Geralt&#39;s or the princess&#39;s eyes look as natural as Yennefer&#39;s?
I love the show. I thought it was great. I can‚Äôt wait for the second season. If you are a gamer at all, you need to play the Witcher 3. In my opinion it is the best game ever made!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m13s"">3:13</a><br><br><br><br><br>that shit got real mad quick,, fuck me
Wait he hasn&#39;t played the Witcher 3? He hasn&#39;t played the best game of the last decade? I can&#39;t......
Jeremy I&#39;ve been watching your videos since 2012 and I haven&#39;t missed one. I love your content and value your opinion, I&#39;ve taken into account countless numbers of your advice on films and games but now it&#39;s time you listen.<br><br>PLAY THE WITCHER GAMES! Your life will be all the better for it, please for your own sake play them. (If You don&#39;t want to play all three just play Wild Hunt). Ciri is the MOST important character in that world, the books and games explain that.
Dude, play the game!
Late for the party lol but good job
I liked the story, the characters and worldbuilding, but the chemistry between Geralt and Yennefer didn&#39;t do it for me. The series needed a couple more episodes to make me believe that these people do care for each other.
Love it so far
Im telling angry joe
Great review!!!
I liked it but I would have had Ciri show up in the second season, or the end of the first one as a small girl like in the books.
That unintentional(?) reference about pitchforks...
Am I the only one who didn‚Äôt think that Cavill didn‚Äôt entirely pull off Geralt? It just kind of phoned in and lacking charisma.
Oh warring kingdoms. I heard boring kingdoms <br>Really both apply
I never played the game, but this series is just waw!. In my opinion you do not need to play the game to enjoy the show..
Lmao I was thinking when I just started watching that it better not disappoint me like game of thrones lol
Won‚Äôt lie Jeremy, I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt at least played the 3rd one yet...you‚Äôll probably appreciate the series more from reading the books but the game is a great platform to get started too.
Loved the show much.... And I just don&#39;t get the love for Yennefer, I think her in episode 1-3 is amazing.... But once she&#39;s fully form I just can&#39;t buy her as an Almighty sorcerers. <br><br>Lioness of Cintra was the best character but since she had so little screen time, then it has to be Geralt. <br><br>With Cirilla as the worst character with the most boring arc.... Luckily she&#39;s with Geralt now so next season should be better for her character
Jeremy is veering well into Jackman&#39;s Wolverine look here.
Syfy channel quality show with young adult movie quality writing. I was disappointed.
The games takes place way after the series/books lol
Winds howling.
I havent played either. Always wanted to since I heard its like Mass Effect when it comes to interactions but this show definitely makes me actually start playing it finally.
I still enjoy the show but goddamn the passage of time was a really big problem for me. Like why do none of the characters age? I understand the magical beings not aging, but King and Queen of Cintra?
Toss a coin to your Jahns
Finished and loved the season. Jumped into the Witcher 3 for my first time...made me hopeful for Ciri&#39;s arc in the show.
Excellent Review that quite sums up my thoughts on the series.
Perhaps the most annoying thing is, after the whole first season we have no idea why he&#39;s called &quot;of Rivia&quot; or what is significant, interesting or relevant about Rivia at all.
He doesn‚Äôt mention once ‚ÄòToss a coin...‚Äô tsk tsk tsk
casting and costume designs kill this series i&#39;m not coming back for anymore season
U must play the witcher 3
I was legit watching the Mandolorian yesterday and I was thinking if you would do a Witcher review and I woke up to find this üòçüòçüòç‚ô•Ô∏è
Couldn‚Äôt hear a word he said over the noise of that amazing hair do! Are you hoping to be the next wolverine, I mean that‚Äôs a quiff and a half. Even the sides are all perfect and blended. As a bald man I‚Äôm in complete awe and little bit jealous. congrats!
Yo Jeremy, been a fan for who knows how many years bro. Just in case you might relate to Yennefer a little too much, take care of yourself even if it means some time off. I and many others will be waiting when you get back. Take care of yourself if you need too.
My take, from someone who has only played Witcher 3 but loves it, is that it is enjoyable and the three main leads are good but half of the supporting cast were just awful (I&#39;m looking at you Triss) who phoned in their performances and drained the energy of their scenes (the contrast between Caville, who clearly did his research, and those that didn&#39;t, is stark). It also needed an overarching narrator (like the older Dandelion in Witcher 3) to make the three parallel stories more cohesive and threaded together. It can become the new Game of Thrones if they improve their casting (especially replace Triss) and some of the clunky dialogue. Just my take.
I LOVE this series. Geralt&#39;s growls or non-committal &quot;hmm&quot;&#39;s. LOL Oh how irritatingly endearing the bard is!! My ONLY complaint... is the crazy timeline junk!! It&#39;s not smooth at all. Suddenly, you&#39;re wondering if you&#39;ve watched an episode out of sequence!! Other than that, love this. Now... let&#39;s get another season...and perhaps entertain some of these guys in a very, very good series of WoT (Wheel of Time)..hm? :)
Like the books, like the games, the show I&#39;m a little mixed on. I&#39;m up to episode 4, I&#39;ll carry on watching, but I&#39;m not in love with it so far.
It&#39;s okay if you haven&#39;t played the games or read the books. I&#39;m sort of glad because the people behind the show wanted to not only make it for fans but also for people who know nothing about The Witcher. I haven&#39;t finished your video yet but I&#39;m excited to see what non-fans think of it too. <br><br>Okay, I just finished the video and I&#39;m glad you liked it. It definitely has room for improvement though in a lot of areas. The books are insanely good. They&#39;ve taken my number 1 spot on fantasy series...actually any series or book period and nothing has come close to them for me.  Purely a character-driven series. No McGuffins, no forced plot points to make the story move from point A to B. The plot is driven by the character&#39;s interactions with each other. It just gives it so much more weight and I wish more authors (especially fantasy authors) would look at this blueprint and follow it more often. <br><br>I absolutely adore the games but the books are on a whole different level.
Jeremy, my man, I read books, played games, all of them in... Polish, and I must say this to you. Play Witcher 3, right now, whatever you do, drop it, and play Witcher 3 with add ons(Blood and Wine, Hearts of Stone). ;)
Pretty sure many have mentioned it, but I&#39;ll say again.<br>The series is more based on the books than the games, so you&#39;re safe having not played them, but I do recommend it. Skip 1, just play 2 and 3, unless you&#39;re a mad lad like me who wants to play a below mediocre game just for 100% context. <br>Henry Cavill mentioned loving both the games and the books as well, but the voice he&#39;s doing seems based on Geralt&#39;s from the games (except he actually gets to keep his accent).
Ok boomer, but how about part of gwent?
Drinking game: take a shot every time Geralt says ‚ÄúHmm..‚Äù
Play the games Jeremy
Play and review the Witcher games, you will not regret it!
Jeremy, do you have a coupla hundred spare hours? If so, go play the hell out of the Witcher III<br>You can&#39;t outrun destiny just because you&#39;re terrified of it..
OH boy! No hate or anything. But you should stop whatever you&#39;re doing right now a go play The Witcher 3. It among the top 3 video games of the whole generation. So, why are you still here? Go play it damn it!!!!
Never played the games but loved this show, inspired me to start the novels. I‚Äôm all in and loving it
It&#39;s onion
loving these edits hahah
Surprised you haven‚Äôt actually played the gamesüòÇ. You need to play Witcher 2 and 3. 1 is a bit outdated
yo jeremy are u auditioning for wolverine ?
I liked the casting and the story of the Witcher series, the cinematography and directing is however appalling at times and as mentioned by Jeremy it doesn¬¥t even reach &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; to it¬¥s knees. I can understand the less competent CGI effects due to budget restrictions, there is however no excuse for a few of the major flaws already mentioned. One big plus is that they stuck to the books, I would however hire a new director, this show needs far better visuals.
I agree so much, I was confused for way to long. The time jumps and the passage of time where indeed a bit jarring but I really enjoyed the show
The voice he did perfectly imitated his voice in the games thats why he did that
Its awesome that you haven&#39;t played the games . I wish i could play Witcher 3 for the first time ... ( Now im at the 4th play-through :P )
I was so disappointed by this review.. I&#39;ve been so into Witcher, watched it 1st time, bought 3 books, ordered 3 more. Watched it the second time, got the rest of the books (still waiting for 2 to arrive), watched it the 3rd time and now killing time until my books get here, so I can start reading, and he just was all over it, missing all the good bits.<br>And honestly? You don&#39;t have to play the games to do a simple Google search to know that game continues after the book series concludes, so (duh) to tell a full story they started with the books<br>And that game of thrones comparison? What the hell, GoT sucks so badly, I couldn&#39;t get past season 4, why can&#39;t ppl judge Witcher on it&#39;s own merit?
Let&#39;s be real, the Witcher season 1 is better than the last 4 seasons of Game of Thrones. It may not be better than the first 4 but so as long as the show gets better and not worse, we&#39;re in good territory.
Flimsy leather only protects against anything if you are the protagonist of a fantasy flick.
I just hope we never see that bard again, was irritated every time he opened his mouth.
Would love to see they use the soundtrack from the game. Witcher 3 soundtrack was amazing.
If you haven‚Äôt played the game, you owe it to yourself to do so. Great Story, Fantastic Characters, and outstanding music !
I agree with Jeremys points about Yennifer being the most interesting character and the issue with passage of time. Good review
I dont think I know any youtuber that would enjoy Witcher 3 the game more than you, GET ON THAT SHIT DUDE!!
‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the witcher games‚Äù. Igni the bastard. Igni him
The Witcher games are supposed to be a sequel to the books they pick up right after the books. The show is really good but they rush through the books stories very fast pushing ciri but it rushed through the plot in order to have her when in the books she isn‚Äôt even born yet. It is good but yeah it‚Äôs all over the place. Ciri was bad in the show cause it was all filler it‚Äôs better if you just skip all her parts cause it‚Äôs basically she can‚Äôt do anything cause all her plot shit comes later so she runs around the woods.
Yennifers story was annoying as hell. As much as she is a brilliant character and blah blah her story is just so whiny. Every time she came on screen I was like hmmmmm fuck.... When is Geralt coming back on.<br><br><br>Also the fuck was up with the time jumps. Why can&#39;t people just tell a story from the beginning anymore??
I liked the show, felt the end fell a little flat though. I&#39;m not too keen on how much younger Yen looks compared to Geralt. Triss also seems to have had her personality and temperament changed but whatever. All in all, i&#39;m looking forward to the next season.
Jeremy please review &quot;Messiah&quot; a new Netflix show.
After i saw the end of ep. 2 ... that fkng joker singing at the end was so fkng anoying a had to stop the hole thing. That was so bad. We just dont wanna keep watching the rest of it.
The passage of time was alittle rough for me aswell so I bugged my husband about it who has read the books and played the games. And he was like &quot;Yeah they do that weird passage of time in the first book aswell, it doesn&#39;t really tell you how many years the story spans over. We think its something like 40 years but whatever.&quot; <br><br><br>In the show I think its more 20+ years
I was very confused for most of it because I‚Äôve never played or read anything but I still thought it was pretty enjoyable. Wouldn‚Äôt of minded a bit more explaining in some scenes.
The Witcher slaps. Glad I watched it üëçüèº
Man Jeremy Witcher 3 is one of the greatest games of all time you gotta get on that! Loved the show as a fan!
I found this season so disappointing
I&#39;m appreciative of your review. The game is wayyyy better and Ciri is way off .
I haven&#39;t played the game but I&#39;m certainly gonna watch the series after this positive review.
For me the first episode was bad, couldn&#39;t deattach Henry from the character, but then they introduced you with the rest of the world and it because enjoyably
havent played the games and i am WILDLY invested in the rest of the story
Honestly I haven&#39;t played the games ether but I have no interest in the games being that I already have enough hundreds of hours of rpgs to play. And I enjoyed the series enough for a season 1 I will watch another if they make one.
YOU&#39;VE NEVER PLAYED THE WITCHER GAMES!!!????? SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!<br><br>EDIT: just kidding......go and play one, at least the 3rd one. You&#39;ll see where Cavil takes the performance to and from.....and he nails it!
Jeremy, youre a busy man.  But if you CAN get to the game, you really need too.
Read the books even before you americans got them, played the games, watched the show. Liked everything thus far!!! OK, maybe except the original polish film. That ones a mess if I ever saw one.
This show is so hard to watch. None of rhe characters are interesting and the dialogue is terrible. And on top of that we get Geralt for like 10 minutes an episode. Just a sad wanna be attempt at recapturing what Game of Thrones was. Absolute trash.
SHAME... SHAME..... SHAME.......
Just play 3...it‚Äôs the best,and you will get all you need
I like you Jeremy but.. .BLASPHEMER!!!!!!
For the 2 flaws of the first season (Ciri and Timeline). They way you explain Ciri is perfect and the reason is simple, there is no arc in her story, just a fall - the entire season is her going down and down while receiving a reallity shock. Then at the end of the season she finally meet Geralt and glare at the road to climb to the top again. So while we saw an entire arc for Yen to get this witch that we love, hate, love we only saw the first part of Ciri thar for now is basically a line and it will take a little more before we can really call it a &quot;arc&quot;<br>For the Timeline - it is confusing at first and it does give that bad sensation that something is wrong - but instead of a flaw i consider it one of the great strengths of the season. Part because when people get it there that sensation of &quot;wow, then, oh, nice&quot; and you get really rewarded for the second viewing as now you have a grasp of the different timelines you can get all the small tips here and there that gives you a lot of background information of the time and the world
I didn&#39;t care for the show but I did like...<br><br><br><br>TOSS A COIN TO YOUR WITCHER<br>OH VALLEY OF PLENTYYYY
I‚Äôve never played the game either
I think the craziness of time was like that on purpose. If someone has been paying attention they would grasp whats going on early, but to a lot it would keep them on their toes till there is the big reveal. Even if you know its coming, its like a 3d puzzle that you got it just right but not quite and then at then the click happens and everything falls into place in one sweep. I believe they wanted you to have that experience
it&#39;s more than a little ironic that he said &quot;I hope this leather protects against pitchforks&quot; considering this is a witcher video.
GoT was a great setting ruined by lazy writing. Basically once D&amp;D got their fat checks they botched it and left. The Witcher is a passion project for a lot of the people involved. Plus, even though I don&#39;t think this first season was perfect, it was better than the last 3 seasons of GoT.
Witcher positives:<br><br>-Geralt. Easily the strongest aspect of the show. Henry Cavill is perfectly cast. Captivates whenever he&#39;s on screen. <br><br>-Yennefer. Her story is the most compelling arc of the 1st season. <br><br>-Magic system. Chaos, though a little derivative of the force, has a compelling premise of sacrifice. The rules are a little grey at times. <br><br>-Fight choreography. The hand-to-hand swordplay is spectacular. I like the visceral, bloody fight sequences. <br><br>-Production value. The locations &amp; cgi budget were pretty good for tv. <br><br>Witcher negatives: <br><br>-Story structure. This is a big one. I understand that season 1 is largely preamble that serves as a prologue to the books, but it&#39;s very messy. Time hopping is a difficult device to pull off, but they just missed the mark on the execution. This makes everything feel very disjointed and meandering. I&#39;m sure this will be remedied by the three converging storylines in season 2, so I&#39;m not worried about it. <br><br>-Dialogue. It&#39;s not all bad. It suffers most when bureaucrats and royals stand in rooms passively talking. It can be very dry and hard to follow, for casuals/newcomers. <br><br>-Acting. The core characters are pretty good. Geralt &amp; Yennefer are excellent. Ciri, Istredd, &amp; Jaskier are very good. Some supporting characters feel very wooden. Acting is supposed to simulate the spontaneity of real conversation, and at times it&#39;s too obvious that these are actors reciting a script. <br><br>-Exposition. This is a little unfair to critique so early into things, but a lot of names are dropped. A lot of locations are said. They don&#39;t always handle the exposition of information well. I get the sense that they&#39;re serving their core audience first, which is the right way to go. A byproduct of that is that it&#39;ll take longer for general audiences to become invested. <br><br>Season 1 score: C+<br><br>I&#39;m definitely excited for season. Most of my criticisms are technical and will likely improve as the series goes on.
&quot;I haven&#39;t played the witcher games&quot; I think you need stronger leather ü§£
I don&#39;t understand anything about the witcher and I&#39;ve seen 5 eps
Yep, Started Witcher 3 right after the serie (no, I didn&#39;t touch the other two, there weren&#39;t for sale and I&#39;ve been told the 3rd is better, so frag it) and it felt exactly like the right continuity. And I&#39;m totally TEAM YENNEFER !!!!
#1, The guy NAILED the voice, and the character. I was worried. Now I believe. <br>#2, They better go into his past, as it is awesome.<br>#3, They have to go deep into EVERY ONE of the main characters, which is why I believe, Season 2 will make or break the series. <br>#4, HOWEVER, Ciri&#39;s story is the best one, so I hope they do it justice.
I hope that after this we&#39;re getting the Watchmen review.
I&#39;m glad this is doing good and for the most part everyone is enjoying it
Haven‚Äôt played the games or read the books. But you nailed my thoughts on it.
Just play the game dude it&#39;s only 99999999999 hours long
Bro plz play Witcher 3.  And then listen to the audiobooks or read them if you fall in love with the world.
Anyone else gonna start playing Witcher 3 again to fill the void til 2021?
Correct on all counts
Honestly, I haven‚Äôt finished Witcher 3 and it‚Äôs been years since I played<br>So watching this show knowing a few bits but honestly very little was actually fun
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=6m13s"">6:13</a>
Jeremy, I will buy and gift them to you on Steam if you have a PC. Promise from me to you. You would love those games man they are great.
I know you cringed when Yennefer(before she was hot as fuck) and that lightskin nigga fucked
Has Jeremy ever discussed Mr Robot? I‚Äôd love to hear his thoughts
Thank you Jeremy. I&#39;m sold.
So the thing about Yen is in the books, she‚Äôs kinda a raging bitch. For example in one of the short stories in The Sword of Destiny which the show skips she has a long running affair with Istredd after she makes Geralt move to nazair with her. She sleeps with Geralt by night and Istredd by day and doesn‚Äôt tell either of them about the other. So some people don‚Äôt like that the show waters her down. I don‚Äôt really have a problem with it though because imo she was already watered down in Witcher 3 and was better for it.
I hate that the break between seasons will be so long.
Jeremy, i wholeheartedly recommend playing Witcher 3. It is the best game of the decade. Period
Day 4 of asking Jeremy to review The Godfather
You didn&#39;t give it a score m8?
The show is based off of the books. No need to play the games just read the books.
Jeremy please play witcher 3: wild hunt. I guarantee you will love it.
Me: Finally, he&#39;s reviewing the Witcher.<br>Jeremy: I&#39;ve never played the Witcher games.<br><br><br>Me: FUCK!!
3 Characters? ... what about Jaskier!?
The bard actor did a great job........because you wanted to punch his face.
Same here Jeremy. I have all of them on steam, but I started playing Witcher 1, waaaaay later, to play through 2 and 3, and there was so much jank there I couldn&#39;t get past it.
I don&#39;t get why everyone is so obsessed with this show, it&#39;s just a stand in Game Of Thrones, except worse. Almost every part of the show, except for Geralt, is absolutely terrible. I was shocked how well Henry Cavill did as Geralt, because I hate Geralt, but I was happy to eat my words. The sets, the directing, the lighting, the acting, the writing, are all terrible. It all feels and looks so mediocre.
Look, you don&#39;t have to be a fan of the game or even the books to enjoy the Netflix&#39;s series. Jus&#39; saying. Hell, it might even be preferable if you&#39;re neither of thoes things. You go in fresh with no expectations.
What are you waiting? go and start playing The Witcher 3. <br>Is a masterpiece.
In the off chance Jeremy sees this: Geralt&#39;s voice is very similar to the game voice actor.<br>Also, I thought you were talking about a DND party at first, not an actual party
This definitely gets the Dogshit award for sure.
Jeremy: &quot;Dont know if leather blocks pitchforks&quot;<br><br>SPOILER ALERT: <br>It doesn&#39;t
Jeremy, you&#39;re missing out on arguably the greatest game ever in Witcher 3. Not even kidding.
@Jeremy Jahns<br>Actually, the series is based of the short stories, we haven&#39;t even gotten to the books yet.
At the risk of sounding like i have a thing for asymetrical looking little girls, i wished they showed more at the school for mages cuz thats the type the lodge catered to. üëÄ
Don&#39;t worry Jeremy, I bought each of the games when they went on sale and even after watching the first season, I haven&#39;t played them, hahahahahahaha
I&#39;ve only played a few hours of the 1sr game.....i do like the show so far.
Overall I really liked it, especially the first episode, but I didn&#39;t care for the jumping back and forth in the timeline. Until the 4th episode, I thought the Geralt, Ciri, and Yen stuff was happening at the same time, not years apart. There&#39;s even a point in Yen&#39;s storyline where it jumped forward 30 years. It can be extra confusing when you have 3 stories mostly taking place at different points in time and you have no idea how they sync with each other.
No it doesnt block them. Go and play the games! Or at least the third one! 200hours of awesomeness!
You can still play the Witcher 3. It holds up pretty well. You won&#39;t regret it... Or maybe regret it a little!
I loved the bit where Angelica Houston turned the kid in to a mouse......no...wait..that&#39;s not right....
I&#39;ve read the books and played the games and was satisfied with season 1. Didn&#39;t care for the casting of Triss Merigold and the elf boy that tags along with Ciri wasn&#39;t needed. Definitely worth a watch.
That point Jeremy talks about where he got hooked? It was Jaskier&#39;s song, I&#39;d stake my Gwent deck on it.
Please play the fooking gamesüò¨
It‚Äôs good but if you haven‚Äôt read the books or at least played the games, you‚Äôre going to be lost lmao
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m47s"">3:47</a> - Ciri was so confusing because they cast her exactly like the girl in the village then the girl he saves from the mob in the first episode.  I had no idea if they were different at first.
Woooow the party went out of control way too much üòÇüòÇüòÇ but I think the whole season in my personal opinion was amazing
Ciri was the the daughter of the hedgehog and other blonde (Pavetta?)<br>They died at sea...we guess?
I absolutely loved the Witcher. I&#39;ve watched the series twice already, and will probably watch it again before this new year is done. I had no issues with the time jumping, it all knitted together seamlessly in the end, and I too have neither played the games nor read the books.
Everybody&#39;s talking about The Witcher and I&#39;m just really excited about The Outsider on HBO, which is a great tv show and I wish somebody would talk about it.
You not playing the games brings an interesting perspective to the show.
You prick play witcher 3 now
Jaskier best character<br>I have spoken
I just bought The Witcher 3 and have only seen ep 1 so far. Looks fantastic so far
i like the fact that you liked yennefer the best cause shes defo my fave character of the story, but also in the books dandelion or bka jaskier is my absolute favourite where as in tv show they made him closer to the annoying version he is in the game... i like how they did the books but with cavill who is the game fan and did geralt justice and sort of catered to the game fans this way<br><br>i liked the show im a huge witcher fan the books are really good and even the books its all about characters for me they are very well thought out
Only ep2-ep4 is good, the rest sucks!
I enjoyed Yennefer&#39;s arc. Her humble beginnings, her struggles and humiliations, her sacrifices, her growth. Even her reluctance to be a hero. <br><br>It was nice to finally see a complex, flawed yet determined female character. Too many nowadays are flat, one dimensional, overpowered, and BORING. Yen definitely stole the show.
I got into the books from the games.  I just didn&#39;t really like the dragon episode like I thought I would for a few reasons and Sodden Hill wasn&#39;t as visually appealing as I&#39;d hoped from the way it was described by a side character in one of the books.<br><br><br>I&#39;m not seeing it mentioned that often, but Season 1 is based on selected short stories from two anthologies.  Yennefer&#39;s parts are largely original since the books don&#39;t really show her point of view this early on.  Some of it feels eh, but yeah I like most of it the way I like the first season overall.  I hope people stick with it.  <br><br><br>I really hope we get to see Ciri on Ice and that it will be awesome.
No witcherüòï
I agree I thought it was a good show but I was confused a lot because I never read the books or played the game but overall I liked it
Great review :) I would suggest you at least try playing the Witcher. My first was The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, and its my fave game ever. However has The Gentlemen come out in the US yet? Id love to hear what you thought of it, already seen it twice now here in Australia üëåüëå
Will you review the watchmen?
Tbf I hadn&#39;t played the games since I watched the series. Then I got a switch lite for Christmas and witcher 3 complete edition and I love it
Wow. A fair review from someone who wasn‚Äôt already familiar with the source material. It just took actually watching the series. Good on you, Jeremy.
Did u see the TENET trailer yet?
I personally loved it from the start. My fav character interaction was renfri and geralt. And that fight scene was great. His and the stunt double for the chicks hand were bleeding and they kept going.<br><br>O and the music was fkn fantastic.
Witcher 3, man. Play past the tutorial and into one mission.<br>Yes, it needs a bit to start going, and the tutorial drags on, but once you&#39;re one mission in you&#39;ll suddenly find yourself doing side quests you forgot you accepted and BAM... few hundred hours later, you&#39;ve finished everything
That yennefer analogy nails it. I think that if they listen to audience feedback there&#39;s some serious potential for season 2 and on. in the meantime...PLAY THE DAMN GAMES
I&#39;ve never played the games. <br>Love the books though. And Yeah, Ciri&#39;s story was a little weak in the show.. The books do a much better job at showing the connection she and Geralt have . They met when she was really young and are so adorable together that when they are reunited you actually feel something. In the show they had no interaction and were kinda just thrown together?<br>The books are amazing and if you want more Witcher I would highly recommend them.
but the witcher was a year ago :o
Love the series.
I actually liked how it played out too, at first I was confused but when I realized what they were doing... I loved how the show didn&#39;t hold your hand to tell you what was what. You had to piece that together yourself.
Just started witcher 3 after I watched the show. I wish I would of done the opposite.
I agree with your review, I‚Äôve never even played three games either. The show was a bit cheesy, the CGI bits were stupid, At some times the storyline got boring, but overall it was an OK show
Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>OH VALLY OF PLENTY
Damn play 3 atleast
Toss a coin to your Witcher!
Jeremy you are a gamer aswell. I know you like the old games. And mortal combat and stuff. But please just play it, we don&#39;t see you for a month that is fine. then review it. I&#39;m here since a couple of thousand subs. And you deserve this game please trust!!!!
For example Yennefer&#39;s story starts +- a century before the fall of Cintra when Ciri run away from a castle.
Aint played the game or read the books. I think the show started of strong. I liked Geralt and Jennifer. Ciri just was not interesting for the show at all, nor the bound between her and Geralt. I think the show ended weak, but i am looking forward to a season 2.
Boo this man, Booooo
This guy needs to stuff a sock in it.
Compared to the games, it looks more like The Witcher 1 rather than Witcher 3, in that dark, gritty atmosphere. But it&#39;s a somewhat faithful adaptation of the books, i didn&#39;t expected that they would adapt The Last Wish stories like the dragon or the &quot;Law of Surprise&quot; stories, and they did an amazing job with it.
I love it, definitely emersed into a new world I haven&#39;t played nor read the books. I&#39;m a normie but I might pick up the books or game.
Im here for JJs techno club impression<br>&quot;DOOF DOOF&quot;
Thank you for this review so that I and others know that this show is DOGSHIT if you have played the games or even know what the witcher is. Fucking hell.. I cant even go to one place from another in the game without a voice telling me an entire storyline.
If I had one complaint it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm not sure I like what they did with Triss. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not gonna be one of those idiots who hates  her cuz she looks nothing like how she did in the games (admittedly that did throw me a bit but I learned to accept it) it‚Äôs just the fact she was a central player in said games but in the show she‚Äôs basically a side character with not much going on in terms of motivation or personality.
No offense Henry. You‚Äôre still a snack. Yes. Yes he is.
honestly you should play at least witcher 3
HHHHuuuuuummmmmmmm......
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!? WHAT IS THAT!?!??!???!?!? THATS NOT CIRI! JESUS CHRIST! THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!!! YOU COULD FIND LIKE A MILLION INSTAGRAM MODELS WHO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE CIRI! THE FUCK IS THAT!!!!!! THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! <br>Also what the fuck... is Ciri trying to find Gerald but not reversed? Did they even read the story? I sure havent but I have played witcher, witcher II and witcher 3. To be honest I have of course played witcher 3 the most. Man I hate this show even more now. The only damn movie they made out of a video game that was somewhat okay was Tomb Raider but that was because she was hot in the movie as well. The plot was shit of course. But she was hot and I was 13 and you all know what happened. Whops!
How did he not sing the song?
This show was horrible. I quit and trashed it at episode 7.
Can we get a Watchmen review?
Toss a Coin to your Witcher!!!
Play Witcher 3 NOW. You wonr regret it.
I was lost until i figured out they were time jumping then I was in.
You are late to this review and on top of that you haven&#39;t played the games? smh
This show looks cheap has hell tho
Me: I yes finally the witcher review<br><br>Jeremy: i don&#39;t really know what a witcher is
Yennefer is juiiiiicy  unccc uncccc uncccc <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=4m08s"">4:08</a>
this part of the video just killed me ;&#39;))  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m39s"">3:39</a>
What would really really make me happy: That Jeremy Jahns plays Witcher 3 and make a review of it
Didn&#39;t like the show.
Where is that damn pitchfork when you need it ....
Like the Apple AIü§£ü§£ü§£
He hasn&#39;t played... the games...<br><br><br>We Riot.
Heh...pitchforks
I haven‚Äôt played the Witcher games either. I‚Äôll defend you, the mob with the pitch forks will have to come through me first.
I mean I only played The Witcher 3.
Fuck
Can you do a video of your thoughts on the Morbius trailer??
Please play The Witcher 3 Jeremy. It will ruin most other RPG&#39;s for you.
Toss your coin to the Witcher... Jaskier? He&#39;s one of the best characters. Every time he comes on, it was fun
Me: (activates Axii) &quot;I think you are gonna buy Witcher 3 and all its DLCs now, you&#39;re gonna play em, and you&#39;re gonna love them&quot;
This is a hateful comment for not playing the games !! &gt;:(
Boo play games,  at least  2 and 3)
The time &quot;passing&quot; part was not pretty good, especially when it was characters meeting again, about a decade past according to the characters themselves, but even Jaskier looked exactly the same.<br><br>But each character following it&#39;s own timeline was something I loved, cuz you basically don&#39;t know how much time passed between Yen starting school and finally meeting Geralt, only that it was at minimum 30-40 years considering Foltest&#39;s age and appearance.
Ciri&#39;s party is gonna be starting soon, lmao!! :D Especially when Bonhart shows up!
YOU DID NOT PLAY THE WITCHER GAMESü§Ø??-
i feel like im the only person in the world who thinks this show is trash, except geralt
I loved the timeline twist, it gets good around episode 3-4
The games are irrelevant to the series. They take place after the books, and they&#39;re non-canon.<br><br>The series is an adaptation of the first two books. The third book is where the main witcher saga starts. I&#39;m assuming that will be the following seasons to come.
For some reason I found yennefer extremly annoying
Jeremy, have you seen Parasite?
Based on the book but definitely copied geralt look from the games lol
You gotta play Witcher 3 man:((((((
About the timeline :<br><br>Saw the showrunner say on the shows podcast that yennefer story takes place over 70 years, Geralt&#39;s is about 20 years and Ciri&#39;s 2 weeks
Dude I&#39;ve never played the game or read the books and the series is still pretty damn good I enjoy it a lot
&quot;I don&#39;t know if leather blocks pitchforks&quot;<br><br>Certainly didn&#39;t help Geralt if you know what I mean ;)
Jeremy, man, soo.. what was the verdict?
great tv show, too bad they chose the wrong actress for Triss, shes not a bad actress,but she looks nothing like Triss!
I thought the CGI was great. Each monster looked perfect, I would like to know which monster you thought looked bad
I didn&#39;t read the books, but I love the games. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m hesitant to watch this series as I have high expectations for it and don&#39;t want them shattered. üò•
This review is too accurate
Dude Henry sent it home on this one. From the first time he spoke I was hooked.
Apparently, conservatives are offended because this show depicts a woman using a sword.
I did not. Like first episode and almost didn&#39;t watch episode 2 but I did and by 4 I was into it. Now I am a advocate of the show. But I agree timeline is fucked, like how did 10yts pass and the singer didn&#39;t age a bit
Series suck on explaining backstories, It should be called Witch not witcher because its about Yennefer not Geralt.<br>Spoiler alert<br><br><br><br>In books Yennefer looses her fertility because of mutation that makes her become a witch. In series she on her own will gives away fertility to become beautiful. Right after she starts bitching and suffering because she can&#39;t become a mother. It&#39;s stupid. Makes no sense since she gives it away willingly. In books witches can make themselves look the way they want because they are powerful magicians.<br>Her character arc is dumb in the show and I can&#39;t for the love of me understand why they wrote it this way in the show.<br><br>On top of that the retrospection are messy since it&#39;s not really shown when it&#39;s a retrospection and when its present. Even as fan of the books at several occasions I got lost for a while. Can only imagine how messy it must be for people who think that Witcher game is the source of the world
I found it cheap
Now go play the game lol. Wild hunt.
Henry Cavill is a pc gaming nerd not some console shit......<br>Shove this console players!!!!!!
You should do a video on the Morbius trailer!
RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2
It&#39;s not a good GoT-replacement in the sense that they&#39;re not <i>really</i> in the same genre. Except maybe aesthetically. The Witcher, in all its incarnations, is closer to a fairytale satire; it has the same magical thinking and fanciful &quot;rules&quot; that children&#39;s fairytales do, but it also has an authentically crapsack medieval world outside of them, to serve as contrast. The protagonist, instead of being a young person whisked away and enraptured by magical creatures, is a cynical, curmudgeonly senior citizen who hunts magical creatures for a living, and is downright sick of magic and adventure and everything. Many of Geralt&#39;s quests, in all mediums, are parodies of classic Grimm stories.
Do you ever plan on playing the games?
Agreed... Yennefer has been the most interesting character thus far.
I want longer videos JJ!  4-6mins are too quick, not enough
You should play the games Jeremy. I think you&#39;d enjoy the story and gameplay!
loved this series!!
2 things<br><br>First. Now a great time to play the game. Worth the time. No pitchfork<br><br>Second. The game is the same in how you get into it. You&#39;ll play for a bit. Think to yourself and this is boring but I heard it&#39;s great so you&#39;ll keep playing. Then at some point around the Baron you&#39;ll be hooked
The time jumping back and forth could have been done much better. Also a little disappointed with the season finale.
Nice jacket
You should play them I highly recommend them. Really fun all around.
Only the weird ones actually sit down and enjoyed this shit show complete ass
GO PLAY IT !!!
while i love the games and they helped me establish who&#39;s who and where places are, it has kind of made me expect characters to look a certain way (fringilla and triss) and netflix and the writer have said they will continue color blind casting, so im expecting some big characters to get race swapped or look nothing like they&#39;re said to look like
Jasker Is the most over the top and annoying character. wrecked my head!
So many people seem to not like the first episode, including Jeremy apparently.  I think it&#39;s amazing!  And ends in the fabled massacre of Blaviken.
Loved the Witcher you have to play the games to
the show is great, hope it lasts long enough for us to eventually get a live action adaptation of wild hunt the game. Gunna take a while considering the games are book sequels, but let me dream.
Lol if you don‚Äôt like his voice it‚Äôs simply because you didn‚Äôt play the games he literally sounds just like him
The Games are awesome. Got me into the books. I&#39;m happy we getting a season 2.
The books are sooooooo good, they aren&#39;t even in the same level as the games, much less the series.<br>The games are a cool experience, you should totally play them.<br>The series is fine, I liked it, but they fucked up Yennefer and Jaskier. I mean, really, if you liked Yennefer in the series, you NEED to read the books, they toned down her character SO MUCH it&#39;s offensive.
&quot; I haven&#39;t played any of the games&quot; <br><br><br><br>I could throw shade but,  GLASS HOUSES  AND ALL THAT.<br><br><br>¬†I just picked up three not a month ago, I&#39;m hundread hours in, and barely touched  a story quest; Not to mention the DLC.  I only watched the show for more context, and it helped with that a lot.  Dandelion/Jasiker is best thing on the planet.
Hey I also haven‚Äôt play the video games and read the books.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather blocks pitchforks‚Äù<br><br>It doesn‚Äôt...
The GoT comparisons are week. Two shows in the same genre couldn‚Äôt be more different.
He didn&#39;t play the game.....
Do review Sex Efucation
10/10 would recommend playing Witcher 3 wild hunt. You don‚Äôt need to play the past games so great place to start!
The show is an excellent piece to watch. Now give me live action Mortal Kombat!
I haven&#39;t played the games or read the series. But as a series, it was rough, it had a lot I liked, but a lot that wasn&#39;t good either. I will say, it did not lose me though, I am all in for season 2, knowing that the first book of the series will most likely be adapted and the costume designer has been replaced. I also hope Netflix throws more money at the show knowing it was such a huge success. Then the problems will be ironed out. I will never watch season one again, but I think season 2 has very high potential.
Hmm. Might wanna look around some.
Witcher 3 is overrated just saying
(<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m20s"">0:20</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m30s"">0:30</a>),Brutally,honestly, savage, and thank you, ever since season 5. We&#39;ll probably get the Witcher treatment for G.O.T. reboot (books to games or to anime) once the books are set and done. Well If.
&quot;Hmmm&quot;, sounds familiar, &quot;Taboo&quot; anyone? And also, your hand gesture at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=02m30s"">02:30</a>, &quot;Her Tragedy&quot;, almost said what you had actually in mind ...  :-), I mean yeah, we all loved &quot;her tragedy&quot;
You are doing a disservice to yourself not playing one of the greatest games ever made.
you should play the games brah
Can&#39;t believe you have never played it.
Such a disappointment though as a  book fan ...5/10 :/
yennefer is a babe &lt;3
Great üëç show Henry Cavil made the series amazing !!
I just finished it. It was really good, but I HATE cliff hanger endings in shows or movies.
I liked it and it is certainly enjoyable but man this first season did a terrible job explaining this world, the people, the places, history, the fucking geography of everything. And its structure of timelines was awful... and yes it comes together in the end but that doesnt change that for majority of the season you dont know when things are happening.
Play the Witcher 3 and review it, simple fix
Funny you mention a pitchfork because that‚Äôs how Geralt ‚Äúdies‚Äù in the books... don‚Äôt worry folks. Ciri saves him.
&quot;Henry Cavill&#39;s voice...&quot; ...is from the WITCHER GAMES!! At least play Witcher 3. Geez
Henry based his voice on the Witcher in the game&#39;s
Yo please do the gentlemen
Agree 100% with the party notion
Oh yeah, the passage of time is a whole issue. Even with the books they do a whole bunch of unannounced and unexplained jumps forward and backwards to give one or two scenes context
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who feels that yennefer and her story was meh and found Ciris to be more interesting.
He doesn&#39;t play the video game.....GET him!!!...lol. great review Jeremy
Toss a coin to you&#39;re Witcher, oh valley of plenty
Will you ever play the wither 3? You don‚Äôt really need to play the other gams to catch up and I would love to see your video review of that game
Don&#39;t worry about playing the games, these take place before the games..in fact this is just book one and the first witcher (game) takes place after the third book from what I understand
Jeremy plays games but has never played the Witcher 3...okay...well get to it and enjoy it in the future. Great franchise. Great channel
Play the Witcher.
So your favorite part, is the stuff not in the source material.
Go and buy The Witcher 3 right meow. You will enjoy it!
This is not fucking game of thrones...
I now actually want Jeremy to start a let‚Äôs play series on witcher 3, think it would be interesting to see his reactions to everything
wow this video feels like old Jeremy vids. You can really tell he was into making this one. Maybe I am crazy idk
The more I watch Jeremy the funnier he gets. Idk why but it just happens
This is cavils best performance by far and it‚Äôs definitely not the best performance on the show has potential to be very special. I‚Äôve been hearing people throw around game of thrones special and well no it‚Äôs not that good but game of thrones season 1-6 is untouchable so that means nothing
TBH I wasn&#39;t hooked till episode 4... that timeline stitching thing made me ask more questions and got intrigued by the series and the characters altogether
ohhh, Yennefer! ooooh mamma!
The nightclub analogy is spot on! üòÇ
Dude.... no.... that&#39;s like the game of the decade for me, the show is it&#39;s own thing (not very historically accurate casted) but all things aside... FKN PLAY THE WITCHER 3. LIKE RIGHT NOW.
What a big mess this was. Nothing was earned or made sense
Have not played the games, nor read the books the first episode of the witcher didn&#39;t quite catch me like the first episode of the umbrella academy (another series based in other medium I also didn&#39;t know anything about). So I only watch the first episode and now Im rewatching stuff I know its good.
Never read the books or played the games, but I really liked this series. I hope we get a few more seasons.
Jeremy... Men.... U r a gamer guy... How did you not played the best of game this generation?...
The witcher fans don&#39;t use pitchfork, calm down.<br><br><br><br><br><br>We may bring silver swords however.
I feel in the minority but I couldn&#39;t get behind the show. Pacing is bad and the show hasn&#39;t given me a reason to like or care about any of the characters. I&#39;m also unfamiliar with any of the source material. I&#39;ve only made it to episode 5 and I&#39;m struggling to get motivation to finish the season
Now please do WATCHMEN
This is the most honest witcher review ever
Is the writer Puerto Rican?  You keep saying yennifer
Played the games multiple times, currently reading the books, loved the show.<br>The witcher is my jam.
Actually the games are direct sequels to the books
Is Jennifer as fine in the show as she is in the game?
Fuck
Well she <b>CAN</b>  Teleport or &quot;portal&quot; to places.
Geralt is the protagonist, yeah, everything happens through him, but Ciri is one, the story is based on her and she‚Äôs at the centre of it all. You‚Äôll see
play the witcher 3 now
Witchers are basically mystical orkin men (as Rob Pearson explained)
Review the witcher 3 please :)
Read the books,play the game, and I guarantee you will enjoy it.
Overall I enjoyed it, but I hated the romance between Gerault and Yennefer. It wasn&#39;t believable at all and was annoying. Also didn&#39;t like the transitions between the past and present, it was confusing at times. Loved the action, violence, nudity, magic elements and monsters and overall lore of The Witcher.
If they intended it to be based on books, they did a terrible job. Lore is all messed up. But overall a good 7/10 from me. Also enough leather can block a crossbow bolt, let alone pitchforks
-Witchers voice: Because I&#39;m medieval Batman.
Can&#39;t believe you didn&#39;t mention Jaskier...  Brought some much needed humour to the chaos and blood letting.  Looking forward to seeing Geralt, Yennifer and Ciri next season.
I like reviews more from people who are first time meeting the lore. Otherwise they already have bias from something that isnt the thing they are reviewing. Just my 2 euro cents on the matter.
The Witcher stories/books predate GoT.
Since your on Netflix review ‚Äúyou‚Äù while your at it
You have so much to look forward to with the witcher games - Witcher 1 shows its age, 2 is excellent, and 3 is just next-level
Great moments but the timeline jumping was slopplyi executed. Some of the costume design was just not very well done. Overall its decent but they need to fix the timeline stuff.
Can u do a review on Dracula
Puts the Mandalorian to shame
Funny, I found Yennifer to be the second most annoying character in the show, right behind that fucking bard.
GoT season 1 was long and dull.   Sean Bean kept me going.   It was just too many privileged white people.
Pls review the entire season of Watchmen
I agree if you have read all books and played all the games, it is way easier to understand what is going on. I love what they did with Yen storylines because it was lacking in the books and in the game series its more of a side line thing. I was happy with the time given to Tish though. I am not a big Tris/Geralt together fan but Tish on her own is an amazing character in her own right. Hopefully we will get to see better sorry for Ciri but I get that her real story doesn&#39;t start until she is a teen.
If you think you are missing a party while being with Ciri, well, get use to it, because saga is about her, she is the main character, not Geralt.
Gf: There&#39;s a new show on Netflix we should watch! It&#39;s called The Witcher!<br>Me: How about a round of Gwent first?<br>Gf: Nobody in Velen can best me!!!
Am i the only one who thought of a D&amp;D party when Jeremy said Party lol?<br><br><br>P.S: Never Split the Party ;-)
If you knew the stories than you wouldn&#39;t have made some of your complaints lol. I get it, you shouldn&#39;t have to read the books. But i mean...it&#39;s a show heavily based on them so haha
Jeremy: I‚Äôve never played the Witcher<br><br>Me: lucky bastard, I‚Äôll envy your first (after my 4th)
play the games..thats all im sayin..it doesn&#39;t matter how long it will take for you 4,5,6 months play them youn regret it..then we will se you doing review on the games ...:)))
He said &quot;i don&#39;t know if leather blocks pitchforks&quot; OMG what a spoiler
Hmm...<br>I only appreciate and take opinions from people that have read the books and played the game.
Henry is absolutely perfect as Geralt
I&#39;ve played all 3 games, totally fell in love with them. I love the show, beyond excited for it,I plan on getting the books.
I understand that Henry Cavill wants to portray a great superman but at this point even if he does he‚Äôll always be Geralt of Rivia.
Can do what I did. Watch the show THEN play The Witcher 3. I tried The Witcher 3 before and it didn&#39;t grab me but after watching the show I&#39;m loving it! May have just needed to give it a couple more hours to be fair but, the show worked well getting me in the world.
I don‚Äôt know why it bothers me to have sooooooo many ppl comparing things to got....... I didn‚Äôt watch it, maybe that‚Äôs y.... üòÇ but seriously whenever someone calls something a got ripoff I‚Äôm like why would anyone rip off that garbage before remembering how popular that show was to other ppl üòÜ<br><br>Edit: whole reason I never started got was cuz it seemed like a lord of rings ripoff to me üòÇ it comes full circle
‚ÄúThere was some tweets‚Äù but you deleted twitter Jeremy ü§î
I loved your &quot;mmm-chhh, mmmm-chhhh, mmm-chhh&quot; club music imitation.  ; )
Review the witcher 3 lol
I tell everyone to give it until the 3rd episode. And so everyone who has watched it agrees.<br>Def happy to see season 2. Hopefully not too long to wait
Great voice-over!!!...lol
Bruh seriously, you haven&#39;t played the game?ü§îüò≤‚òπ
Yay! I‚Äôve been waiting for this reviewüíú!
If I remember correctly Henry Cavil also used to be a huge fan of WoW
I¬¥m not angry that you didn¬¥t play the games jeremy... I¬¥m just....just dissapointed *shakes my head
Whyyyy Jeremy - whyyyy! Play Witcher 3 - it‚Äôs definitely worth your time.
Wow I wonder if he knew Geralt actually got stabbed by a pitchfork or if it was just our coincidence!! ü§îü§î
Love it. The games are massive spoilers for the show as there set way after, but still have call backs to the time of the books, so going right for the game because of the story might be a bad idea, if your worried about spoilers. Felt it was a good translation of book to screen.
&quot;Controversy is a strong term... There are some tweets!‚Äú<br><br>Perfect
&quot;I haven&#39;t played the games.&quot; &quot;Have YOU played the games?&quot; <b>doesn&#39;t even ask about the books or express any interest in reading them whatsoever</b><br>God I hate Americans.
The witcher was awsome
If there‚Äôs one game you should never play after the Witcher 3, it‚Äôs breath of the wild. Makes a great game like botw seem so much less impressive after. You‚Äôd love the Witcher 3 mate
What I really loved is how three dimensional most of the characters are whether they&#39;re main characters or side characters.
Toss a coin to your witcher o valley of plenty
So I‚Äôve only played the Witcher 3 game and some of the short stories and loved it. After watching the series it made me feel it was the yennifer show even though I liked her character in the third game I didn‚Äôt like her in this show I didn‚Äôt feel there was anything redeeming about her character also it felt like Ciri and gearlt where side characters in their own story and show because I really loved the gearlt stories and quests more than anything and I wanted more of that however I‚Äôll wait to see what the show next season does
clicked like before the video even started out of sheer joy that this review had finally happened
PLAY THE GAMES NOW
Finally<br>Thank you for reviewing this show Jeremy
Ciri&#39;s story will be more prevalent in season 2. Please nobody spoil it for Jeremy!
I too have never played or read the Witcher books, and was lost for a bit. But the show gets you so interested in it that you enjoy watching the puzzle pieces come together. <br><br> Yennifer is also my favorite character on the show. I can&#39;t wait to find out what&#39;s going to happen next.
I know it sounds snobby but J.J. but if you want more Witcher there are like 8 books. Yennifer is in them....
I&#39;ve never played the games but I know some lore due to some friends who are obsessed with it. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the show. We had to a pause A LOT to figure out where each story took place in the timeline because it wasn&#39;t very clear lol. Seeing as all three have caught up with one another, I&#39;m hoping season 2 won&#39;t be another puzzle. Anyway, I&#39;m gonna go pick up the books now.
Yeah!! ThanksüôÇüôÇ You made my day!<br>I was so hoping you would review the show.  Sorry, for pestering you. Your opinion means a lot. I am very glad you liked itüòÄüòÄ.
Hey Jeremy, could you review Netflix&#39;s Dracula series, from the creators of Sherlock?
&#39;You&#39; series on Netflix was flaminüî•üî•dog shitüëåüèæ
‚ÄúToss a coin to your Witcher‚Äù
I think the show really kicks off in the law of suprise ep.
The Witcher: Why am I not the main character? The show has my name!  Yennifer: Because everybody loves me.
He tossed his coin to your Witcher, reviewer named Jeremy, reviewer named Jeremy  oh-oh-ooooh (works with the tempo of the song at least XD)
Petition for Jeremy to play The Witcher 3 w all of it&#39;s DLC
I&#39;ve watched the show 4 time through...that kinda says enough.
A great review as always. Who needs any other source of film criticism when we&#39;ve got Jeremy Jahns to turn to!
Watch and review Watchmen next
I think they nailed the foundation, and I expect it will get even better with future seasons. I 100% enjoyed it more than The Mandalorian.
Yennefer was your favorite character? every time she was on screen I was on my phone, which is a lot of the season
I have only played through Witcher 2, and tried many times to get into Witcher 3, but the darn controls and combat is so bad.
Not enough gwent üòí
Jeremy  as a huge fan of the witcher  games...Of you play games..do yourself  a favor..and play Wild Hunt...The game is better than the TV show
This is nothing like Game of Thrones. It is its own thing and its awesome
I agree that Ciri was the weak point. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the actress playing or, or just how her story is written. But I think the show would‚Äôve greatly benefited from just removing Siri from season one. It was such a drag every time we‚Äôd go to her. <br><br>Personally I think the best moments of the show are when Geralt is with Jaskier, or Yen, or both. But Geralt is definitely the driving force for me. I always want to see what he‚Äôs up to. <br>Triss was also not very interesting to me. Don‚Äôt care to see much more of her.
Good to know that the games take place after the books
Never played the games but this show is a great mid-evil mythological adventure fix for me. Really enjoyed it :)<br>And I&#39;m actually a pretty big fan of Siri&#39;s story.
Let&#39;s not forgot that Garalt got Queen Calanthe off without even touching her
I&#39;m watching &#39;The Magicians&#39; right now and I hate how fast time goes by and you don&#39;t learn with the characters and kinda hate the characters but I can&#39;t stop watching it.
I took me till about the sixth or seventh episode to realize the timeline was cut-up. Everything made a lot more sense after that.
Spoilers for the Witcher Season 1 <br><br><br><br><br><br>The thing I‚Äôm having trouble understanding is how magic works. The first magic thing we learned is that magic isn‚Äôt free, then it‚Äôs like never brought up again (besides the eels?) and Geralt can cast his mini spells (signs) with no problem, and yen can conjure portals with ease. <br><br>I didn‚Äôt have this problem when playing the third game because I was never under the impression that there was some cost to preforming magic.
.....I haven‚Äôt played the Witcher games either. üò¨
Here‚Äôs my Witcher season 1 review.  It‚Äôs fracking awesome and I can‚Äôt wait 2 years for a new season
I mistrust anyone who says, ‚ÄúMake it so‚Äù without a Picard reference.
The show also didn&#39;t tell you what time setting you were in present or past. I was confused as hell in the beginning.
üé∂ Toss a coin your Witcherüé∂<br>üé∂O‚ÄôValley of of plentyüé∂
Actually even if the author denies, we fans can accept both the books and the games as part of the same universe as the games are the sequels to the books as in the events in the game takes place right after the ending of the books. So there&#39;s that...
Animal abuse for clothing isn&#39;t acceptable, Jeremy.
JEREMY: READ THE BOOKS AND THEN PLAY THE GAMES!!!
Finally dude!
Witcher playthrough when?
Jeremy I recommend you to give it a second viewing it once it makes more sense the show feels different and much better
Great video! ...And for some reason, watching this makes me want a Hard Sun review by you Jeremy lol
Why does Yeneffer say that the order of mages made her infertile by the end? It was all her ..
Hmmmmmmmmm fuck
You haven‚Äôt played any of the Witcher games! I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù typing this but seriously?  Didn‚Äôt the last game win game of the year?! Jeremy you are doing yourself a MASSIVE disservice by not playing Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.  It is a masterpiece.  That game is one of those games that transcends its genre.  Its a game that is so rich in lore and storytelling it just sucks you into its world better than any current MMO out there.  The gameplay elements are great, the monster hunting contracts are great, and the exploration is immense.  Go play the game Jeremy.  Just play Witcher 3 though, you don‚Äôt need to play the first two to enjoy Wild Hunt, the game catches you up to speed so you don‚Äôt feel confused about whats going on
Waiting Jeremy to react on the new Morbious trailer!!!!! Hit the like so he can see this commentüôÉ
well,  before you play the games, you should read/listen to the books :P<br><br>the show&#39;s jumpy, because this season is based on the short stories rather than the novels, but that&#39;s no defense - the passage of time I feel like tried to mimic WestWorld, to questionable results. Technically, in the world of The Witcher, sorcerers and sorceresses and Witchers age very very slowly, so the passage of time wouldn&#39;t be that visible, really. It should&#39;ve been visible on Jaskier or queen Calanthe though.
I would of preferred a more linear, chronological approach, but I did like it a lot more than I thought I would.
Jeremy you haven&#39;t played the witchery games? üò≤üò≤üò≤ You haven&#39;t played something I enjoy, unsubscribe
Controversy<br>There were some tweets<br><br><br>Yeah that enough to call controversy these days anyway. Hell entire news articles are written for a single tweet
It‚Äôs ok, I only knew Geralt from Monster Hunter
Cool show but I have absolutely no interest in playing the game
For the love of God, Jeremy, PLAY THE GAMES!!
Thank you for reviewing and giving my favorite series exposure!
I also haven&#39;t played any of the Witcher games.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And I&#39;m not wearing any leather. Tell my family I love them.
It was way better than the first Game of Thrones season.
As a person who wants to play the games and hates Game of Thrones with a passion I really liked this show and am looking forward to the next season. I want to read the books now and Im gonna try to get those games before season 2 ü§î
Really enjoyed this series.  I read the books (yes there are also books) and now I am playing the video game.  The game is insanely big and long.  Side quests man....  They are everywhere.  But I&#39;m having fun with all of them.  Can&#39;t wait for season 2 and maybe a witcher 4.
Thumbs up for The Witcher.  And I&#39;ll toss a coin his way.
Play the foocking games
Jeremy, that&#39;s a cool review! Loved your thoughts, they were quite deep actually! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
You are goofy AF, but really liked your review. Loved the show, seems I went on the same ride as you. Outside the main hall of the party (smoking a doobie).üòú
Henry is a famously huge nerd. Almost lost the role of Superman because he was doing a raid on WoW. <br><br>Also, Jeremy. If you like this series, you&#39;ll love the games. The first did not age great, but the second and third are fantastic. Witcher 3 is one of the best games I&#39;ve ever played.
No one says fuck better than Henry Cavill in this
Honestly I didn&#39;t care for Henry Cavill, the show is great inspite of Geraldt... The show for me was all about Yennefer, her development was amazing. To only have your life be worth less than shite and wrestle your fate away from the mediocrity of tragedy and weave your own fortune was amazing.
yes we finally got witcher but we didn&#39;t got death stranding
Jeremy we know you like video games, and we know you like movies. The Witcher games are about as close to a combination of the two as you can get. You can pick up the Wither 3 pretty cheap now a days and you dont need to play the first two to understand whats going on, and that game truly is a master piece.
Glad jeremy enjoyed the show
It&#39;s strange to me that someone who loves Legacy of Kain enough to have a tattoo from it wouldn&#39;t play The Witcher. They&#39;re the only two franchises that equal each other in narrative complexity in my mind.
Actress for Yennefer killed it
I loved the show. Was disappointed that it was only 8 episodes aha. Can&#39;t wait for season 2! Apparently its going to a long while before it comes out.
Yes, the passage of distance in time! My Only issue
&quot;...Game of thrones...&quot; <b>sharpens pitchfork</b><br>&quot; [half decent witcher facts&quot; <b>puts down pitchfork</b><br>&quot;Haven&#39;t played the witcher games&quot; <b>sharpening intensifies</b>
Show made me start a new game on Witcher 3.
&quot;Dunno if leather stops pitchforks...&quot;<br><br>Well Geralt knows, mate.
You should check out some footage of Geralt from the games. Cavill does a 1 for 1 impression.
Ya the passage of time Is a little hard to notice because the 2 main characters age much slower that normal people
Play Witcher 3 dammit Jeremy.
Jeremy thinking ciris story isn&#39;t the heart of the witcher series.<br><br>oh boy.
thank you for watching this :) i love this show personally and season 2 will be more streamlined which will be nice :)
As an Easter egg for fans, the horse who played roach was killed after every episode and replaced by a different horse named roach
Henry whispers and only whispers.... üó£Ô∏èüëÇ
Me: Finally, he&#39;s reviewing the Witcher.<br><br>Jeremy: I&#39;ve never played the Witcher games.<br><br>Me: Hmmmm....
How could you not playing witchers games?
Not a Word about jaskier and roach? I&#39;m disappointed :(<br>(Not really but... You k ow. For the Drama.)
So you like good series. Watch Dark.
The Watchmen S1 came out before this though Jeremy, am really disappointed you haven‚Äôt reviewed itü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Hadn&#39;t played the games or read any of the books and I still loved the Witcher. I&#39;ve also seen a lot about the timeline being confusing but it wasn&#39;t a problem for me, although a friend had told me there were multiple timelines before I started watching it.
Hmmmm....fuck
<b>‚òº You have the happiest life. if i had your skin id have the happiest life. lived life in your skin. i meant lived your life, this is not about wearing your skin as a suit, b4 you ask. unrelated: do you do fan meet ups? and how does one sharpen a filleting knife? so flimsy, the blade. it needs to be, to get under. but also sharp. nm. forget the whole thing.</b>
the only problem with the show for me was the time jumping. I got it from the get go, but it fucked the pacing up a bit in some episodes.
Well I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;ve only ever clocked in about 1 hour in the Witcher 3 and I&#39;ve never read the books so I&#39;m coming blind into this series as well and my goodness did I have a blast of a time.<br>I agree that Ciri was definitely the weakest of the 3 storylines it felt like it dragged on for far too long, the cgi is fucking laughable at times (looking at you episode 6), but hot damn did Henry Cavil and Yennefer&#39;s actress make this show amazing.<br>Also there is a massive plot hole with regards to Yennefer&#39;s character in this series (spoilers for anyone who hasn&#39;t watched it yet, you really should), but in one of the episodes Yennefer states that the mages guild (or whatever it&#39;s called) took her choice away from her (her choice being whether she wanted to look sexy or have a child), she didn&#39;t just make that choice herself, but she fucking leapt onto it and the series just kinda forgets about it going forwards. It would have been amazing to see her wrap with the ramifications of her own choice rather than the whole &quot;iM jUsT LiKE yoU brOKeN witHouT a ChOIce&quot;
great show...timelines were a bit confusing, but damn fine show overall.  Need more high quality stuff like this.
I was waiting so patiently for this lol
Bro... At LEAST play the witcher 3... At LEAST!!!! It is certinaly time consuming, but you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a more immersive and rewarding gaming experience!!! And i feel like hearing you reveiw it would make a LOOOOOOOOT of ppl&#39;s day
YOU HAVEN&#39;T PLAYED THE WITCHER GAMES?!?!?!?! BLAAAHRGGHGHHHHL HELP NOW I&#39;M BLIND!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=4m09s"">4:09</a> <b>onsh onsh onsh!!!</b>
No love for the Bard Jeremy?
I didn‚Äôt care for this show what so ever simply cause I don‚Äôt know shit about any of it!!!
You were looking at your phone when the scenes about the time came up lol because if you were psying sttention its really clear in episode 2 and 3 that the time is nonlinear. I know this because I rewatched it and went damn. I shouldnt have checked those dms lol
very fair review. really wanted to know what someone coming fresh to the witcher world thought of the show. Much as i enjoyed it I thought it didn&#39;t do a great job of establishing the world
‚ÄúBecause we all know of Yennefer‚Äù
Its actually great to see a review of someone who has not got 100+ hours of love for this franchise.
I know you that the show tells you a lot of hints . On my second rewatch I caught a few but most notably was on episode 1 or 2 they mentioned that Calanthe won her first battle when she was twelve and then in one episode Geralt talks about it marking the timeline he is in. At one point Geralt was out and about when calanthe was just twelve years old. And obviously we have pavetta and Duny marking the timeline that ciri is not born and then another where we find out that they have died . So you start catching these bookmarks on first viewing when you try to make sense of it but you get more hints once you understand the goal of the show. They could have handled it better but I know the appeal of having Geralt , yen and ciri in the first season. The primary people interested our Witcher 3 folks first and book people second and then people looking for a GoT sub third and people looking for any show fourth.
Review DARK
Do morbius trailer
you really liked Yennifer the most? weird, being a huge witcher fan and reading the books I really wasn&#39;t keen on her in this series. It;s still decent don&#39;t get me wrong but I thought Geralt and Ciri were much better acted and portrayed in this series
Worst part about Witcher is cast and scenario
You haven&#39;t played The Witcher games? You should be ashamed of yourself.
I haven&#39;t played the games but love the show
I&#39;ve been a fan of the Witcher for 30 years now. Even though the books predate the current fashion for grimdark fantasy by over 20 years they are still one of the best entries in the genre. Definitely better than Martin&#39;s. <br>I found the show ordinary. Just ordinary. Like a 1990s fantasy TV series with a bigger budget, better production values and less fun.
You are not alone Jeremy. Although I knew of the games, I didn‚Äôt play it until after seeing the series. Love them both now!
The focus on the characters is why the games excel as well, just focusing on characters and their interactions within a world bigger than them
Ayyyyyyy!!!!!! Play the GAME! 9/10! Awesometacular!
At least you watched all the episodes and enjoyed it
the witcher&gt;the mando
I really like you‚Äôre take on the review! The Witcher is a show I dig.
Unsh unsh unsh!
I only played Witcher 1 planning on the other games. But the atmosphere is really dark and charismatic at the same time.
You don&#39;t need to play the games too understand the show..... But you do need to read the 6 books
He made a perfect Pitchfork joke and didn&#39;t even realize it!
boo
The games aren&#39;t necessary to understand the show, but I absolutely recommend playing at least the third one some day.
My biggest issue was the fact that the timelines weren&#39;t expressed properly which did cause a lot of confusion. I had to listen to the behind the scenes podcast to be told.<br><br>It&#39;s fine that you didnt play the games it&#39;s just a different interpretation. But if you enjoy open world fantasy then you should try it out.
Thoughts on our good friend, the bard, aka Jaskier aka Dandelion?
I can‚Äôt decide if I should buy the game or the book. 2020 starts off with difficult dilemmas.
<b>**SPOILER ALERT**</b><br><br>He does the entire review and doesn‚Äôt mention Jaskier.....
I looooved the show and it does resemble the game highly! Geralt is so sexy üòç
I think it wasn&#39;t until episode 4 til I realized what they were doing with the timeline; however, and I don&#39;t know if this had anything to do with their thought process, but I felt the lack of certain references in time kind of did an interesting job of portraying how timeless/long--lived characters might view the world. It&#39;s like, hey I saw you last week, what do you want, and they&#39;re like, um, it&#39;s been ten years, boyo, but he just shrugs, cuz ten years, last week, same dif, right?
Lol would you believe that someone offered fringilla and triss to look the best they want, but they went with the netflix looks instead of the games looks? :D naah
As a fan of The Witcher series who had only read one book and played Witcher 2 &amp; 3, I love the series and the world of The Witcher. There are a lot of lores in The Witcher as the world is massive. Every character has an interesting background and each region is different from the other. The continent consist of Temeria, Cintra, Nilfgaard and Skellige ruled by different kings. To truly enjoy The Withcer, you need to know the lores imo. This series is good for me. I thought it would be a failure but i was pleasantly surprised by how much I like it. The series is not very welcoming to newcomers as there are a lot of lores to dwell into, it take times to get to all of them and the series didn&#39;t introduce any lores. If it keeps improving, I bet we can get a good 7 seasons out of it to finish The Withcer series. It gets crazier from here on out, hopefully we get to see The Wild Hunt and get introduced to vampires in Touissant
Play. The. Games.<br><br>Or at least just the last one. I don&#39;t know shit about the first two tbh...
Love the show, can&#39;t wait for more...<br>BUT.<br>Any idea why the Nilfgaar armor looks like worms on black foam and poo?
I‚Äôm a huge fan of the games and waited 3 years for this show to come out. So far I have watched four episodes and love it. I am determined to watch the show like people drink a fine wine. Best enjoyed slowly.
PLAY THE GAME FOOL!
Shame on you Jeremy
Toss a coin to Jeremy for this wonderful review
I haven‚Äôt either I watch the show. Then I played Witcher 3 and I can‚Äôt stop playing it.
I would recommend Songs of War by Black Plasma Studios. It‚Äôs an epic Minecraft-based fantasy series with three planned-out seasons and amazing lore.
Please review &quot;when they see us&quot;
It&#39;s OK, man. I&#39;ve only played Witcher 1 and 2 for a few hours and wasn&#39;t impressed with either. The combat in particular was bad. Dunno how W3 is.
Jeremy you ain&#39;t alone I&#39;m a fan of the series but I haven&#39;t played the game either
Jeremy: I‚Äôve never played the game <br><br>Me: Hmm, Fuck
I love the going in blind perspective. The only downside is that you really don&#39;t understand  how good Caval is in this role without at least seeing cut-seens from the game. He 100% bodies this role, to like a scary degree in my opinion. Other than that, loved your review as always, and remember to always toss a coin to your Witcher.
This Witcher adaptation was a disappointment. Shoulda seen it coming since the showrunner and casting choices.
This man said not ONE line about Jaskier
Let me put it like this - the Witcher 3 has ruined any other game for me because it was so good. Nothing else is appealing anymore. I just want to replay the Witcher 3 all of the time.
If I had Jeremy&#39;s life I&#39;d be so happy!! Even if I only had the hair I&#39;d be so happy.
Pitchfork through leather? Oh Jeremy don&#39;t spoil the books!
I love you, you should try to play The Witcher 3.
BoJack Horseman was great as roach!
&quot;I hope this blocks pitchforks...&quot;<br><br><br>is that a pun from the books?
Mmmmm fuck
You haven&#39;t played The Witcher 3? r u even a gamer dude?
You would like witcher 3, its easy to get into and pretty entertaining
Don‚Äôt get the appeal of Jennefer. At the beginning she‚Äôs gross. Then she‚Äôs a brat. And I don‚Äôt feel like she did anything ever. She just complains and moans about. For the last fight she‚Äôs just an announcer... oh well not for me I guess
Both female sorceress are ugly compared to the games
Just wait for the Stormlight series that‚Äôs in development. That‚Äôs gonna take the world by Highstorm!
play <br>the<br>games<br>blyad
I feel like I‚Äôm the only person in the world who couldn‚Äôt get into the game but still respect the masterpiece that it is, the way Geralt and the camera move is off putting and like I lack control, that‚Äôs mostly the reason why
JEREMY JAHNS HASNT PLAYED WITCHER 3?! actually surprised. hope you give it a try!
What is Jeremy rating??
Yennefer does says ‚Äú30 years have passed since she ascended‚Äù.  But I get how it can be confusing specially since Gerald and Yen don‚Äôt age like normal people.
I actually like that you haven&#39;t played Witcher 3 it&#39;s less bias.
I really enjoyed the show but I felt it did not make use of all its potential.<br>The pros:<br>- the soundtrack was great, same as the games<br>- some scenes felt like right out of the game, especially in geralts fights, the angle of the camera etc<br>- nudity was more tasteful than in most shows Netflix produces<br>- the characters were awesome and even simple side characters showed a lot of depth. There was no real good or real evil, just humans and their humanity<br>- I was afraid of the humour at first, bc it seemed relatively &#39;modern&#39; but I felt it worked quite well<br>- Yennefers story was probably the best one. I really liked watching her story unfold<br>- the sets/locations were nice<br><br>the cons:<br>- the passage of time, so like a decade passed in the show and I couldn&#39;t tell at all<br>- honestly Ciri&#39;s arc was so...lackluster. Looking for Geralt could&#39;ve been shown in less than a third of the time they used. I liked the character, but I felt they could&#39;ve put more conflict/goals/development into Ciris journey<br>- the costumes felt out of place. Not bad, just off. When I see a Naruto character I know what show it is with only one look bc there is a clear and distinct style. I missed that kind of feeling in this show. I thought Geralt, Ciri and Jaskier looked great tho<br>- Most of the scenes by themselves are great, but put together they felt off. I don&#39;t know   SPOILER!     if it was bc of the different timelines, but it felt reaaaaally clunky. That&#39;s probably bc the 50 or so minutes of each episode weren&#39;t made use of as well as they could&#39;ve. The episodes seemed to drag at some points, and I was like &#39;ok get to the next scene already&#39;. Watching the Mandalorian it was a big difference, bc it feels like the timing is just perfect. No  useless dialogue, no pointless and repeated staring. Not the same with this show.<br>- there were too many confusing moments. The episode with the dragon still confuses me to this day, so does the situation with the mages and their stupid conflicts. Not everything needs to be subtle. Sometimes having a very clear explanation can help and there were a few of them.<br><br>Still, it was a good show and I am really excited for what comes next. I think this is the very first game to show/movie adaptation that I actually enjoyed (I know it originally was a book but still). Looking forward to season 2 and more
I thought the witcher TV series was gonna be absolute trash!<br><br>It wasn&#39;t, but there are problems with it that some people might have trouble looking past for fairly legitimate reasons.<br><br>The initial problems presented before the show even came out where still there, the ugly ballsack looking armor the nilf&#39;s wear, some characters being changed from the source material for what is the clearly the sole purpose of &quot;diversity&quot; and the story&#39;s timeline not being totally clear.<br><br>At it&#39;s core though, the story, writing, action, and the acting where all very enjoyable
You really missed an opportunity to play toss a coin in your party analogy
We all knew what jeremy was about to confess when he zipped himself up.
It&#39;s just weird seeing so many black people in fictional Poland...
There are visual and spoken clues as to where in the timeline the scenes are... its just not always obvious
Would be great to see your take on <br>Lost in Space Review???
Yennefer most tragic:D Yeah, Geralt got such a wonderful life.
The games are a lot of fun, definitely recommend it. I&#39;m watching You atm
Jeremy, you could definitely just play Witcher 3. Its designed for new comers. Also, I never read the books, so the show seemed great to me.
Why do you and Mike Zeroh have the same voice? Is that your brother? ü§£
The games are basically a continuation of the story from the books. So you did not miss much. As a fun of the books, I did not like the show. They changed too many characters in very weird ways that it took me out of it. I didn&#39;t like the stitching of the story. They took some of the stories from the two books with collections of stories and mixed them with the main saga. And the nilfgard Ian armor. I am going to watch next season to see where are they going with this. Hope Netflix will throw more money at the show to polish it up a bit.
First episode was defiently the roughest,  which is a shame cause a lot of people will quite at that ep
PITchFORKKKKK.................play it
Jeremy, Jeremy. You are doing yourself a disservice by not having played the games. If you‚Äôre too busy, pull up a YouTube play-through.
Two points.  1. Life is suffering and death for everyone, with brief interludes of joy if you&#39;re lucky.  2. Cavill experienced Batman&#39;s snarling voice in the DC movies and wanted that for himself.
I really ... really feel like it should have been 10 episodes.
No mention of Jasker? Legitimately was the best part of the show.
It&#39;s funny you should say &quot;pitchfork&quot;.
Finally a reviewer who acknowledges the terrible storytelling when it comes to the time that supposed to be passing, the whole jumping back and forth in the story is absolutely annoying and always takes a few seconds or even minutes to work out...since theres no indication usually (apart from the one time jeremy mentioned when she jennifer mentioned its been years since they seen each other)
It‚Äôs not great but it was fun and got better as it went on so it could become great
Medieval slavic fantasy world with token black people. Typical Netflix sjw dick move.
Ma&#39;am thought he never would
Played the games and the read the books, The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is also my favourite game, I loved the show it&#39;s everything I wanted out of the first season
Everyone in this show whispers. We had to turn the show off because we couldn‚Äôt understand anything anyone was saying.
Never played the games, But heard a lot of people talk about them when they first started coming out. I&#39;ll say one thing the characters are at least recognizable at first sight... most o f them at least, so it&#39;s got that going for it.
Absolutely loved it, actually filled the hole GoT left. Not the same feeling, I feel GoT still does the world a bit better. Like this is still a lot of &quot;shot-shot&quot; while GoT actually showed the travelling, etc. Made such a big difference.<br><br>People were freaking over brown Yennifer but since I never read the books, and quit Witcher 3 after like 15 hours, I didn&#39;t care, and damn, for all I care, Anya absolutely killed the role.<br><br>Only time I felt disconnected from the world was the dragon episode, and the final episode where he got attacked by those ghouls. They looked so...CGI lol. took me outta it.<br><br>EDIT: if you rewatch the first episode, there&#39;s actually a line the little girl geralt meets, alludes to the different timelines. But everyone misses it lol
Play The Witcher 3 I didn‚Äôt until I finished the show and it‚Äôs actually incredible
The games are a sequel to the books üëçüèª
You need to play the Witcher games.
Passage of time is indeed a flaw in this show, but not a major one. I did however had to rewatch the wedding scene to finally understand the Law Of Surprise thing. They glossed over it a bit too much while it&#39;s a very important aspect I think.
Took me till the episode he was fighting the incest monster for me to really get into it. Wasn‚Äôt as good as I thought it would be but still finished it in a day
What f%#@ never played Witcher??<br>Neither did I.
The Witcher 3,Possibly the best game of the last decade
Waiting for the Morbius trailer reaction to drop
I came at the Witcher much the same way. Haven&#39;t played the games (yet), and very vaguely know about the world. My only issues with the show was the non chronological order that must have been a meth induced executive decision, and a solid introduction to the world. I found I was really not invested in 99% of the characters, since I have no idea why they are fighting/running/etc.
Toss a coin for ya witcher o valley of plenty o valley of plenty
I do hope they do more with Triss Merigold in Season 2.<br>Thus far I feel like she&#39;s been more of an afterthought.
7-8/10
Its funny you mention pitchforks after what happens to geralt in the books
I love love loved that you see him take the potions to power up.
I only watched the first 2 episodes and I could believe how boring they were. Some of those shots could have had 10 entire seconds removed and they would have the same effect. These episodes should be at the MOST 40 minuets long, not a whole ass butt fucking hour.
Some pacing issues but otherwise solid... and the show was good too üëç
Its a good thing that u came clean about not playing the Witcher games.<br>Since u have been my go to YTuber for movie reviews, ill give u a pass.
I agree, it‚Äôs interesting. Having read the books, yes, it follows the book very closely. Unfortunately, the book jumps around in time just like the series, so it gets very confusing. I had to explain what was going on to my wife and daughter. The liked it but its hard to understand if you haven‚Äôt read the books.
Almost spit out my lunch because of Jeremy&#39;s club joke
Great show üòÖ
I think the timeline was kinda wonky
Am I the only one who was confused af about the timeline on this series? I also thought yennefer was the villain of it so when I googled it and it was like &quot;yennefer is geralds love&quot; I was even more confused cause I for about 6 episodes I thought shed be the antagonist
Jeremy, play the game. You won‚Äôt regret it.
Cgi for mandalorian was only better because the mandalorian was 30 minute episodes after credits lol
Hmmm fuck: the series
Sorry but I don&#39;t get Yennefer hype. I mean she&#39;s good but it gets tiring to hear all series long &quot;wow you beautiful&quot; &quot;you&#39;re a talent&quot; &quot;you&#39;re the best at ...&quot; whenever it gets to that point it just gets boring.
Awesome to know you listen to your audience! Great review and definitely agree on the passing of time not being clear at times hopefully season 2 works on it
Toss a coin to your Jeremy Jahns<br>Oh Patreon of plenty<br>Toss a coin to your favorite movie reviewer<br>Friends of humanity! <br>I watched this show not knowing anything either, felt choppy the first time but the second time I was enthralled picking up literally the SUBTLE one line here and there that connected the episodes and passage of time, ex: the first episode the king literally mentions in one line about the time they got married, ep.4 later... :P
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather stops pitchforks.‚Äù<br><br>Hahahahaha they don‚Äôt, good sir. They don‚Äôt. Those crazy mobs and their pitchforks sure can be dangerous.
Did she teleport?<br>Probably.<br>Also the passage of time not really affecting protagonists is a strength, I feel.<br>It gives them a unique, detached perspective and the ability to live with a bad decision forever.<br>Which is half of Geralt&#39;s morality right there.<br>He knows that choosing sides means you have to live with being responsible for the outcome.<br>Which is why he keeps getting angry when a situation makes him care. He is acutely aware that all those people will die one way or another while he may just see the world end because he saved a child.<br>Which is where the stereotype of the emotionless Witcher comes from.<br>They try their hardest not to care about the mayflies around them because it hurts too much to see them die every time.<br>Witchers and Mages are super interesting immortal characters.<br>Mages in the amoral political schemes, Witchers always in the thick of their fallout.
I didn&#39;t like this show that much, glad you liked it though.
So listen. I had the exact same complaints as you did and that&#39;s really rare for me. Passage of time was a MESS for me, but then I talked to someone and they go &quot;Think of the show as cyclical&quot; and that really helped me on like the third episode figure out what was going on! I honestly think Jaskier is one of the better characters too (but maybe that&#39;s because I think comic relief was needed several times). Also- the witcher community on reddit is super welcoming to any fans, not just those who have played the video games or read the books- they&#39;re literally just stoked to talk to more people about the Witcher, and I love that.
henry cavill got that geralt voice down perfect
The party description was too accurate
Its good you havent played the games. Means at some point you can still enjoy them!
I was expecting them to recast yennefer after the transformation instead of just getting rid of the hump
The wisher is better that the LOR and GOT combined.
That &quot;f....&quot; -quote....fantastic! xD
I played the games and read all the books, the series is by far the worst thing in the witcher universe. When I watched it I was thinking a 6.5, might be leaning towards a 5.5. Without the background I had as a big fan I wouldn&#39;t have finished the series.
The Witcher &gt; GoT style over substance BS
Witcher 3 was ok, takes a while to get interesting, but definitely not a must play title.
&quot;I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games&quot;... Well fix that shit. At least Witcher 3. Just know that the games take place after the books so you&#39;ll be seeing how it &#39;ends&#39; (Author doesn&#39;t consider the games canon)
You should totally play the games
You should Play Witcher 3 is amazing
You haven&#39;t played the witcher? <b>sniff</b> im so disappointed.
<b>Puts knife, gun and pitchfork down</b> Allright, Jeremy. Since it&#39;s you. Just this once. But seriously, play the games.
The passage of time worked well for me. There are a plethora of clues in each episode that indicate when a scene is taking place. The larger time jumps are there because the years in between aren‚Äôt needed to tell the story. <br><br>Also, the show has to be ‚Äústitched together‚Äù in the way that is so that the audience does not receive certain information prematurely.
I&#39;m pretty sure at one point where Geralt and Yennefer meet after their first encounter she remarks she&#39;s been advising and working for royal families for decades. This show you definitely have to pay attention or you&#39;ll be lost in the time jumps
My nerdy ass when Jeremy starts talking about Ciri not being a part of the party:<br>YEAH! IT DOES FEEL LIKE THE DM HAS HER ON A SEPARATE ADVENTURE!<br><br>Jeremy: Not that kind of party, dork-lord -_-&quot;
&quot;I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games&quot;... O_O... You where the chosen one Jeremy... You where supposed to bring balance to the Force not leave it in darkness!!!... Anyway, Witcher 2 and 3 are amazing you should try &#39;em out!
Finally
<b>Early much</b>
The Witcher 3 is the best game
Omg ur actually a moron
Am i the only one who hasn&#39;t watched Game of Thrones?
Maybe Henry Cavill will take on the role of Dracula someday, he sure likes to show off his teeth in this one!
Jeremy has some Josuke hair going on
Why haven‚Äôt you played them? Do you hate yourself? Do you hate fun?
Blocking pitchforks was a very appropriate choice of words
They took 2 books and mashed them into one season
Haven&#39;t played the Witcher? I thought I knew you Sir.....
Do yourself a favour Jeremy, watch a full in depth recap on The Witcher 1+2 (or just play them) and play the shit out of The Witcher 3... One of the greatest video games of all time!
Spectacular Games that stick the landing and Spectucular Series that also stick the landing.. but more roughly
If Alexandra daddario was cast as yennifer this series would have been perfect.
The games are really just a sequel to the books, so it really could be based off of both if you want?
The party metaphor was very apt. Something about Ciri&#39;s arc was really weirdly executed. I also did not care for the timeline confusion. Overall I really liked it tho.
You don&#39;t need to play the games to enjoy this because it was based on the books.
Is any reviewer ever going to talk about all the out of place black people mixed into society I&#39;m i the only one that this seems odd i mean if Wakana in avengers had aload of random white people i would say the same thing it just doesn&#39;t make sense... also changing Triss Merigold to a black woman seems theres abit of a political agenda at work here and i have saw zero reviewers talk about this is everyone scared out of fear being called racist.
The Witcher 3 game is awsome
Not that I‚Äôm qualified to give advice but if you enjoy the series or the video game: read the books. The short stories are brilliant and it‚Äôs a wonderful mix of heart, comedy and action
Leather Jacket + 4 armor
They used the passage of time to mask the twist Jeremy. I thought that was clever making us find out for ourselves
Only criticism I have is just the timeline and pacing.
Yes, Henry is doing an impression of Geralt&#39;s VA from the games, and he&#39;s clearly sacrificing vocal range to maintain that voice all the time, but outside of that it&#39;s also really spot-on, making him the best damn actor in this whole thing
It got better after the third episode for me. I love how little Geralt talks.
The games are actually a sequel to the books. The time jumps were hard to nail down at first, you had to pay attention to certain characters as well as lines, to figure out where in the timeline you were. However, I think the reason for all the time jumps was because the first two books are a collection of &quot;short stories&quot; so it&#39;ll be interesting moving forward when we get into the meat of the third book onwards.
Other than Yennerfer, Ciri&#39;s badass grandma was the standout character for me
He&#39;s a snack ü§£
Toss a coin to jeremy oh Valley of YouTube
The important thing to look for in a show like this and thrones is the world and lore. Got did a good job with both and made it feel real. But the Witcher, the second I saw triss, fringilla and the Asian villagers I was instantly taken out it. If I saw Black Panther and there were white dudes in African clothing , I‚Äôd be taken out of it too. But Apparently everywhere in the 1200s is America.  Geralt was a side character this season. The show could‚Äôve been called the coven and no one would be the wiser
Henry is a bit buff for Geralt, but he&#39;s awesome. Roach&#39;s delivery is of course intense. Can&#39;t wait for the episode when Roach speaks. Of course I played the Witcher 2 and 3, haven&#39;t read the books yet
Never read the books or played the games so I was totally confused for awhile. I think that actually made it even BETTER  when it totally clicked for me what was going on. Hell , with my discovered realization of the timeline I was eager to watch it again and pick up on all of the clues I missed the 1st time. Toss a coin muthafukas.
It came out just in time to coincide with the steam Christmas sale in which the Witcher had 75% knocked off its normal price. Since i binged the show in a day and a bit...the game will fill a nice gap from now until season 2
play the witcher 3 jeremy, you will not regret it - game of the decade
Love the show. Could use better editing (rides in on roach, goes into a pub, comes out and Roach is completely covered in dead monster for example). Love the games more.
I agree. It need like time stamps. I was confused about what time we were in many times
passage of time is its flaws? People are just used to too much expositions in a movie/series
ba ba ba ba ba basketball, gimme gimme gimme the ball because i&#39;m gonna dunk it!
I agree with everything u just said üòÇ
PLAY THE GAMES!!!!!!
I felt the show was a 2.5 stars out of 5 stars. Henry Cavill and the head magic teacher were the only characters I enjoyed. Yennifer was so emo and Ciri was annoying.
WAITING FOR DRACULA NETFLIX 2020 REVIEW
I heard the books are like the serie, where witcher is not the main plot or character :) <br>Just wished they had more budget for more episodes to show more story and depth.
I love the Witcher books, I love the Witcher games, now I love the Witcher Netflix show, I love the Witcher.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m58s"">0:58</a> Im sooooo fucking <b>triggered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>
Toss a coin...
The Witcher series is better then Game of Thrones
well I&#39;ve had played The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Game and as a Fan the game The Witcher series on Netflix is Awesome
I haven&#39;t played the games either, I will one day but just haven&#39;t had the time to commit 150 hours to a game...
Jeremy, you‚Äôd love the games. I do t usually tell people they‚Äôll love something, but for some reason I feel like they would be right up your alley. Stories brilliantly written in an incredibly vast world.
Compares the show to GoT. <br>Slightly disappointed but understandable all the same.
Started playing Witcher 3 after seeing the show and I have to agree with almost everyone. It‚Äôs one of the best games ever made.
Review was fair. Passage of time was tricky for anyone not familiar with books/games and lore. I just wish we didn‚Äôt know hunchback Yennifer until later like the books.
In Game of Thrones people teleported all the time, but Yen could actually teleport via magic.
I&#39;d give anything to play the Witcher 3 without having played it already.
Review Marvels Runaways
I kinda mirror a lot of Jeremy&#39;s thoughts about the series.  Took me a while to get into it, the time slips were weird and took me out of the show a little, some characters were way more interesting than others, etc, etc.  Cavill out acted most of the others on screen despite being a monosyllabic tough guy type who grunts his way through most dialogues.  The action scenes were very well choreographed I thought, very slick.  But a lot of the plot was play by numbers, for me at least.  Some of the twists I saw coming a mile down the road.  Also there was a lot of narration in the show which really slowed some episodes down in places.  Overall I think they should of explained more about the title character, his origin and the world itself because by the end of season one I was feeling as if I just read the prologue of a book and only now was it getting into the meat of the story.
&quot;hmmm..&quot;
I&#39;m in the same boat, almost. The only thing I knew about the Witcher series is that it was a bunch of games, and the main character had white hair and was called Geralt. I also pronounced his name &quot;Jerald,&quot; because I thought it was just cliche fantasy spelling of an otherwise normal-sounding name. Then I watched the show, loved the shit out of it, and now I&#39;m done with the whole game series. I wanna move onto the books, but I&#39;m afraid it will ruin the show for me moving forward. A lot of readers were disappointed in the show...and a lot of readers of every book-based media are always disappointed. I don&#39;t want to be disappointed with the show out the gate. I think I&#39;d rather the show go through to completion, and then if I want, I can use the books as something that can enhance my love of the series further.
Jeremy, the games are sequel to the books
i wish i could play the witcher 3 for the first time again ohh how i envy you Jeremy
They claim it‚Äôs based solely on the books but that‚Äôs a huge fucking lie. The costumes, sets, hell even the music is straight from the games. The only differences I noticed is that they went with Dandelion‚Äôs original name from the books, Jaskier, and Triss didn‚Äôt have bright red hair. That‚Äôs about it
&quot;there was some tweets&quot; is a hilarious breakdown of what people see as real controversy and that&#39;s why we love Jeremy
The show really is a great adaptation of the first two books, Last Wish and Sword of Destiny, with a few liberties taken. I would suggest people to read the saga and, of course, play the games. The games are not &quot;canon,&quot; but who gives a fuck. Not to be confused, games continue the story where the books ended. The games are more of a &quot;spiritual&quot; sequel. And play the first two before playing the third one. I know that everyone knows about the Witcher 3, but Witcher 1 and 2 don&#39;t get enough love and they are both great. However they are not open world.
I played the first game, then read the books, then got confused, then played the third game, then promised I&#39;ll get to the books and I&#39;m still not reading. But the series were beautiful, I watched each episode with glee and dread and a stuffed animal to clutch.
I haven&#39;t played the games or read the books either.
Literally dozed off watching the first 3 episodes. Didn‚Äôt even watch them on the same day lol, I‚Äôm really trying to finish it but it‚Äôs just not doing it for me yet....
Best RPG game of all time? probably.
never played the game, loved the serie!
New drinking game : we take a shot each time Jeremy has to fix his hair after it collapses under its own weight.
Jeremy: &quot;I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games.&quot;<br>Quen.
It&#39;s probably already been said before, Jeremy, but don&#39;t worry about starting with Witcher 1 and 2. They&#39;re good games, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I think if you watched a few recap videos and started with Witcher 3 you&#39;d be a happy gamer.
For me, the problem with Yen&#39;s attitude is that she blames others for HER CHOICE! She, at one point, says that &quot;they&quot; took the choice  of being pregnant and having a child from her. That&#39;s a lie and it really makes her unlikable to me. The sorcerer performing the spell/surgery to correct her defects actually warned her that something  from her must be taken away in exchange for her beauty. He made it very clear that it would be her childbearing ability. SHE AGREED! She made the choice! <br>The other thing that I disliked about her was that they gave her a cringey monologue she gives next to the dead infant princess saying that she is better off dead because, as a mere woman, she would have been treated as just a vessel from which men take and take and take... It might have been true for common women, but for a powerful witch or a princess, nope! We have examples of very powerful women in the show: Not only Renfri, Ciri, the witches, who, arguably are powerful because of magic, but Calanthe, a normal woman, is a powerful and respected queen, leading her army and fighting alongside her soldiers as a true badass and perfectly capable of being as pigheaded and unreasonable as any man.
I&#39;m jealous that Jeremy hasn&#39;t played the Witcher games. He gets to experience them all now.<br>Play them Jeremy, they&#39;re right up your street!
You gotta play the game sometime dude~
Yes! His voice!
No mention of Jaskier :(
If you never read the books this series might be good for you. If you read them and you are a fan you will hate this. They removed a lot of stuff and added a lot of dumb stuff they made up themselves. They changed relationships and motivations. Killed characters that shouldnt die. Casted actors who doesnt look like they should. Its 5/10 at best. I had more fun during GoT S8.
Can‚Äôt imagine trying to follow this show if you hadn‚Äôt played the games or read the books
Show should of been called, Gennifer and the Witcher was also there.
HE KNEE SUM MILLK.
Go and play the game already
The actress who plays Yennefer is my new crush.
Loved the show, started replaying Witcher 3 right after.
But what about Dracula?
You didn&#39;t even mention jaskier in your review
I&#39;m really hoping this does well so in the future there&#39;s a possibility for a God of War series üî•
Review parasite godamn. Jeremy you will fuck w that movie.
Yennefer/Anya Chalotra was the best part of the show, I really hope they give her more screentime in the following seasons.
*raspy * ‚ÄúHe talks like this all the time‚ÄùüòÇüòÇ and Yen is arguably the strongest character and has been in the books and somewhat the games too!
Compared to game and books show look like mediocre but for newcomers it&#39;s good.
I have also never played The Witcher series. <br><br>Listen, alright I was a teenager when those games came out and I was not, repeat, was NOT allowed to play those types games back then. <br><br>The only reason I know about the game now, is because my sisters bf got me The Witcher 3 on PS4 for Christmas and I have no idea what‚Äôs going on.
Great review, Mr. Jahns.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>NOW REVIEW THE WITCHER 3.
How you no play Witcher? üòµ
I find it mediocre. The only reason I watch it are for Yenifer and  her titties
The fact that Henry cavil whispers all the time is my only issue when it comes to his performance. But I‚Äôve never played Witcher so what do I know
‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the Witcher games.‚Äù<br><br><b>punches</b> <b>through</b> <b>screen</b>
you should be ashamed of yourself!<br>I saw that star wars tournament that you were in Sam Witwer...<br>And you didn&#39;t win!?!<br>oh, and good review
I haven‚Äôt played the games or read the books yet either üòÖ
Yup, passage of time was the show&#39;s biggest problem and it kept me confused
6/10 at best.
I don&#39;t think the Witcher will replace GoT because the Witched is inescapably fantasy. In GoT you could watch it as a political character drama. Can&#39;t do that in the Witcher you gotta love it for the fantasy
When I saw this , i knew u were gonna mention or mimic  geralt&#39;s voice. Hilarious
Witcher 3 complete edition is usually $15 on Gog. It&#39;s very dialogue heavy like Mass effect. I think you&#39;d really like it.
Ur vids r awesome!!but u got late with ur review this time buddy.all the reviews of Witcher r already out.Still liked ursüôÇ
Decent show with good story and great protagonist  but very convoluted timeline, shoehorned social agendas, bad cgi, and the women who play Ciri and Triss Merigold are a joke. 6.5/10
The books, games, and show of the Witcher are all stellar.
Jeremy needs to toss a coin for your Witcher<br>(he needs to play The Witcher 2 &amp; 3)
My biggest problem woth the show is orientation. I have no clue how the world looks like. They keep talking about north and south, but I don&#39;t know what the north and south look like and how big they are? Or how far up north the south is? They need something like GoT or star wars does with the intro. Just so you know what&#39;s going on
Play the game
Geralt snaps Yennefer&#39;s pussy
it‚Äôs trash
TW3 caused my thesis to be finished a month later, because I finished played the game 240 hours during the month after its release. So you might say I&#39;m a fan of the game.<br><br>The show managed to live up to my high expectations and it seems to have created a good base for the following seasons.
Show sux....for me
I‚Äôm gonna start using The Law of Surprise to pay all my debts
I kinda envy Jeremy for not playing the game. He gets to experience them the first time if he decides to. Game has a great story.
Siri was lowkey one of my favorites going through only because i like how she was so good at portraying that shes not trusting of anyone cuz of her status and what they think of her parents and all idk it was cool and yennefer won me over more and more every episode
If you like this then You should watch Vinland Saga it is on Amazon prime
The people are complaining that the Witcher is not the new game of thrones, they don&#39;t get that the show was never meant to be the new game of thrones, it&#39;s meant to be the new Xena the princess warrior, and that it is, perfectly, and I love it for it.
Watch/Review You season 2, its SO GOOD
So I guess it gets a buy on blueray?or no Alcohol required?<br>I can see it being better if you&#39;re drunk for most people.
The show isn&#39;t terrible, but it&#39;s like a 90ies daytime sci fi channel show without any of the charm and I cant understand how the writer prefers the show to the games. Probably because the show sucks as much as the books.
Ffs Jeremy play the Witcher 3
Play the Witcher 2&amp;3
I think if they start with episode 4 instead of episode 1, this would be a far better show, at least it will be so much easier to get into for those of us who only play the game
When the Witcher season 1 is better than the entire last season of Game of Thrones.
It‚Äôs really fun. It has flaws for sure..like lack of main character screen time. But the action is awesome. The tits are great. The story is good enough. The time line is a bit messy but easily fixed with one simple graphic ‚Äú10 years ago..‚Äù <br>definitely worth watching. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2
If it&#39;s any consolation, Princess Cirilla is handled the same exact way in the books initially. So in that respect, The show stayed extremely true to the source material.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m52s"">3:52</a> note 9?
The show is a horrible mess. A horrible, horrible funny charming mess.
Me and my boyfriend love the series so much, that I just had to buy the Witcher 3 wild hunt, and the books are next!!!
Does Jeremy does party drugs?
I agree. Show should explain time jumps. Like just some text.: 5 years later. Cintra. It was a mess and I read the books. They jumped around books. Not even one book but 3 I think. Without any fucking ezplanation or even text on the screen. It was brutal.
There‚Äôs a really good video on YouTube about the Witcher timeline in the games which spoils them but really makes it easier to understand the story and the rules of the world. If you are not going to play the games at least give that a watch. The show has already gone off track from the games so it won‚Äôt be the exact same. But it helps fill in the gaps and why these characters are important.
Now do Watchmen
You always doing reviews and everything, it&#39;s cool, but how about a video titeled &quot;my favorite tv shows/movies&quot;?
If season 2 goes ahead Ciri‚Äôs will be everyone‚Äôs new favourite arc
SPOILERS! <br><br>IMHO the Netflix Witcher series  sucks. They could have done it much better. And what we have at the end: very confusing time lines; some characters are totally different from the books ( and the show runners promised it would be based on the books), Henry is fine, but Yennifer doesn‚Äôt look like a witch who lived for more than hundred years and has any life experience  - she is more like a frette child that can not accept the consequences of her own choices. Triss is a total mess... Kalante originally is a very powerful and honored Queen, the lioness of Cintra, and at the series we have a cranky lady who feels free to humiliate the ambassadors and doesn‚Äôt care to take a shower after the battle to attend her daughters party. Ciri... well her arc was boring and longspun, you don‚Äôt really care for this character and don‚Äôt feel that happiness and relief when she meets Geralt as you should be ( and as it is in the book)<br>The world surrounding the characters is poorly made. The film crew doesn‚Äôt even bother to give the main characters  ( Geralt or Ciri) a backpack or anything of the kind!! They travel, it takes them days to reach certain destinations and they look like they have popped out for ice cream, but not on a long and dangerous quest!!! They must have at least something with them - food or bedroll... <br>Just to feel the difference compare Netflix Witcher to the old polish Witcher series - though their budget was extremely low they managed to create a vibrant medieval world with plenty of details, touching minor and main characters. At least their clothes is not new and shiny!!! <br>Back to Netflix: CGI monsters are terrible. <br>The battle near Sodden is totally wasted. It is supposed to be an epic scene where mages are trying to stop an opponent army. And it shows only that mages are worthless - no powerful spells, no beautiful magic... the only magic they use is to create some explosive bottles that don‚Äôt really hurt the Nilfgard army. And Yennifer saves the day... because this series are so focused on her. Why??? It is so unfair!! Originally  the Sodden hill battle was tragic and scary - 12 mages died and others fought bravely and their team spirit and powerful magic helped them to win, not Yennifer alone. It is totally misinterpreted!!!! <br>And what is this stupid idea about disposable Nilfgard mages??? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense and of course nothing of that kind took place in the book!! It takes dozens of years to train a mage and here they sacrifice themselves to create a fire ball that requests catapult to shoot it??? What a Ridiculous thing... <br><br>and don‚Äôt forget that some stories in the series are so compressed that it is impossible to understand what really happened without reading the original. <br>To conclude: the Witcher Netflix  series upset me deeply. I will most likely watch the second season because I am a great Witcher fan ( books and games) but not because of Netflix.
unfortunately the elves vs humans conflict was simplified to evil humans and elf victims, kinda thought netflix would have been above that
I don&#39;t really like medieval stuff but I loved the witcher because the characters are so charismatic. They&#39;re well constructed.
Good show
The games are also sequels to the books
What you say about Ciri in the show is exactly how I felt about her in the game.
I haven‚Äôt played the Witcher games either.....sorry world!!!!
have you realized Yen and Geralt were in 2 different timelines until they cross each other&#39;s paths? Jaskier is a regular human, so he cannot live as long as Geralt and/or Yennefer, which explains that as a hunchback she was at least a hundred years before the story of geralt was being told. This at the same time explains why the sorceresses are kinda alergic to dimeritium (they use magic to live long, you cut their bond with magic with dimeritium, so they would usually start to &quot;die&quot; immediately, right?)
Really wanted to be a fan of the Witcher... couldn‚Äôt come around
totally love that ciri analogy because yeah her storyline felt totally disconnected at points and the time confusion of it all was a bit weird at times for sure. really enjoyed yennefer&#39;s storyline. and geralt and the bard&#39;s friendship was my favorite!
same i bought witcher 2 days ago humbe bundle has it for 15 usd  its amazing
This series inspired me to read the books.
It&#39;s rubbish forget the hype it&#39;s far from game of thrones or vikings
My wife hasnt ever played the games either so your not alone bud :) she loves the show tho
The games are set after the books fyi
You NEED to play the game. It‚Äôs incredible.
What&#39;s wrong with you ? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Not even witcher 3???<br><br>WTF!!!<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Yeah, me too...
I will give you a thumbs up, but PLEASE PLAY THE WITCHER 3 - this is a game from 5 years ago :), but still the best game in the world
Just started to play the game. Compete the series not knowing much about it. Only heard fans complaint about Triss and black washing.<br>Good series. Excited for season 2.<br>Also, kindly review Messiah.
Go do yourself a favor man and play the Witcher 3 trust me its worth it. I know you loved mass effect and the witcher actually delivers  an acceptable ending that actually has different multiple endings!! not just the same ending in different colors lol
I still don‚Äôt know if I like The Mandalorian or The Witcher more...Story wise I‚Äôd say I prefer The Witcher, but The Mandalorian is way more fun!
The Witcher is the most mindless adaptation of fantasy writting since Shanara by MTV. This show pisses all over its source material and doesnt get anything right. Basically its The Last Jedi or GOT season 8. The sad part is how many drooling morons wont ever read the books and like this bullshit then wonder why hollywood keeps halfassing everything. Edited to give credit to Henry Cavil for playing Geralt. He did a fantastic job with his character. He just unfortunately keeps working with shit directors and production teams.
honestly learning of the books kinda diminished my enjoyment of the show. Not to mention casting choices that just seem like blatant twitter bait. No shade on the actor or anything, they did a good job, but still.
‚ÄúDid she fucking teleport??!‚Äù Yep that statement captures exactly how I felt
I am a huge fan of the games so I have to say that I went into this series expecting the worst but I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought most of the cast did an excellent job and certainly the three central characters.  I thought the scenes from Geralt&#39;s past were very well handed, Blaviken went precisely the way I envisioned it when I read the story and his attempt to cure Adda&#39;s curse was almost a beat for beat remake of the opening cinematic in Witcher 1.  <br><br>Yenn looks a little young for her part, I think a couple more years on the actor would have given her the gravitas that Yenn possesses but it&#39;s still early in the story and she will, quite literally, grow into the role more.  Despite that, I thought she hit it out of the park.  I also admit that I was very skeptical of Henry Cavill as Geralt (since I only knew him from Superman) but he nails the role well enough that you&#39;d think he walked right out of the games. <br><br>I have read three or four of the books but was, honestly, never that impressed with them.  The content inspired by the books (the games and now the Netflix series) has always struck me as far superior to the books themselves.
I thought the show was alright. That is my review. One word. &quot;Alright.&quot;
I need to watch it again.. I‚Äôm still lost ü§£ü§£
Yay finally Jeremy watches this show, glad to hear you liked it. And as someone who played the Witcher 3 I can say the series feels very much like the games. I‚Äôd suggest you play the game but after seeing how long it took you to beat Breath of the Wild, you‚Äôd never get this game done.
Played the games, watched the show, and read the books. Love the Witcher and the lore in it.
The Witcher games act actually more like sequels to the books
Geralt is daddy.<br>Yennefer is queen. <br>Ciri is our OP baby.
I think it&#39;s off to a good start. Room for improvement, but enjoyable overall.
I think they need to rename this season Backstory: The Series. If feels like you can jump right into season 2 and not miss anything. This whole first run could be summed up in a few lines.<br>Ciri - &quot;I&#39;m glad I finally found  you, Geralt. I&#39;ve been through hell looking for you.&quot;<br>Geralt - &quot;Hmm.&quot; &quot;Fuck.&quot; &quot;That bard is annoying but he helps me make money.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll help but I won&#39;t like it.&quot;<br>Yennifer - &quot;I wish I could get pregnant.&quot; &quot;I hate you tied my life to yours without asking me first, Geralt.&quot;
Toss a pitchfork at your Jeremy!
Everything was great except for the casting of Triss
Play The Witcher 3 you chump! Jk you should check it out though
Whoa. I literally just finished watching this...
I truly recommend watching it second time - so many things clicked and it seems less chaotic and actually it&#39;s so entertaining to see how one thing connects to another when you already know what&#39;s going on
The irony of the pitchfork comment
<b>Spoilers</b><br><br><br><br><br>When Geralt and Ciri finally met, I was like ‚ÄúLETS GO BOIS!! LETS GO!!!<br><br>And then the season ended...
I&#39;ve played Witcher 3 and love it. And the show instantly became my favorite show ever.
Yennefer and Geralt also don&#39;t age like normal people, that didn&#39;t make it easier I guess. They should have shown Jaskier aging, but it might have made it even more confusing for people who aren&#39;t familiar with the Witcher lore.
Yennefer is probably my least favorite character in the show. When she‚Äôs weak and deformed I actually enjoyed her character more. It could just be the actress‚Äôs portrayal.
Jeremy: I haven‚Äôt played the Witcher games.<br>Me: Fuck off bard
This was a boring and annoying video
I highly recommend the books and Witcher 3 to anyone who enjoyed this series.
The games and this series are overrated as hell. They‚Äôre not bad, but my god if I hear one person suggest I watch this lackluster series or play this lackluster game, I‚Äôm going to literally kill somebody.
Episode 2 is probably the worst episode in TV I&#39;ve seen in awhile. I dropped the series after the Hunchback of Notre Dame Sex Scene that guy&#39;s acting career is over.
I never played the games, thought the series had some epic episodes, and a few duds. Altogether though, I really enjoyed the character of The Witcher, and thought Yennifer stole the show.
Minus points for the miscast Roach. <br>Sarah Jessica Parker would have been great in that role.
You‚Äôve never played Rdr2 either, so your two steps behind the curve
Yes Yenifer CAN teleport. should have played the game
Finally
Good show but my main complaint is the lack of an actual build up to conflicts. At times it felt like we learned about a conflict 2 minutes before the fighting happened. Which caused a lot of these bigger battles to feel meaningless with no real weight behind it
Play the game!!!!
Just to be Clear ... the series is pure trash .. it&#39;s shallow and childish with a cgi that so bad i wanted to take my eyes off after (10 min) of episode 1 . Teenagers shit with superhero landings trash .. üòëüëé
After the season was over I was like &quot;I gotta play me some witcher 3&quot;... took me a good week and a half to complete  the main storyline and both dlcs and 3/4 of all the side quests and locations...just started game+ last night.....gotta get all of the qwent cards...lol
Please review Parasite!!
My favourite moment is every time Geralt says &#39;Fuck&#39;.
I agree with you about the witcher! Good solid show with 1or 2 hiccups
You dont need to play witcher games because story takes after the books. So dont mind at all.
You really gotta play all of The Witcher games brother....life changing.
STREAM THE WITCHER GAMES! please...
You‚Äôll like the show if you ignore the ASTRONOMICAL expectations of the source material, which this series does not live up to.
I didn&#39;t like witcher 3, there I said it.
The games occur after the events of the books
yaay!!
One thing I learn from the Witcher is that being a Mage fucking sucks the price for power is to great
the bad CGI golden dragon episode was a tad disappointing. that was one of my favorite short stories in Sword of Destiny. the way Borch was treated and the Zarrikanian&#39;s, meh...<br><br><br>The actual short story is WAY more intriguing. I feel like the writer just skimmed most of it and wrote something up quick, and off to the next episode! Hopefully season 2 is a lot better.
Am I the only one who thought this show sucked ?
Thank you for getting to the Witcher! Great video as usual
The Witcher sucked. That&#39;s it. That should be the review. The construction of the world was awful. The story was lackluster. You have no idea what a Whitcher is, it&#39;s all so random. The characters also have no real motivations. It&#39;s just a mush of fantasy content throw it togheter.
Jeremy:I haven&#39;t played The Witcher games<br>everyone: mistake
well, witcher 3 is waiting
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m49s"">0:49</a> it doesn‚Äôt üòâüòâ
How have you not played the Witcher 3 yet bro!! Come on buy, it honestly let‚Äôs you understand so much about what‚Äôs happening.
I like game better. It is true Game of Thrones of games
Just read the books, the book are 1000 X better but the show still was dopeüëç
I actually bought the game because recently because the show was so good I have to play this game see what was all the hype was about.
To me my love for the games and the storys ive heard from the books took away some of joy other ppl seem to have for the show. The time jumps and casting for the characters took me out of it.
But is awesometacular i need to know
what you thinks of messiah series
Thankfully there are few Cringe moments, and there not too bad...but closer to the end they started to recon some established lore, and Reeeally pushed diversity! Which sadly another Ginger was sacrificed to the alter of forced ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù poor Triss Maragold üò≠she was hands down one of my top 5 ginger characters! And they fucked her whole character up! Not just the recasting, but the piss poor acting and story telling, the also retcon Ciris back story and man I dunno. Great show, but I unfortunately I‚Äôve read the books and played the games. But damn did Henry C did a fucking awesome job nailing Gerald! I really wanted More because the Witcher is HIS story! Overall 8/10 but easily could of been a 10 if they made better casting choices and stuck more to the lore! You didn‚Äôt see anyone crying for More diversity in Wakanda, screeching about where are All the White, middle eastern, asain, Mexican people mixed in?!? Just sick of the double standard, they want to FORCE diversity in locations that had a history of being racially white, Asian, or what ever! But are oddly silent when it‚Äôs a location with a history of being racially Black...
Haven&#39;t played the games and I thought it was atrocious
Jeremy is getting a pompadour
You should review Netflix‚Äôs Dracula. Great miniseries
I didn&#39;t know that there were books for the Witcher cause I originally thought that is a live adaption for the games. However after I watched the show, which I absolutely love btw, I started playing the games cause all and I mean ALL of the books were sold out almost immediately. I finished the first two games cause of Winter break since I&#39;m a teacher and jesus christ those are the best fantasy games i&#39;ve played in a long damn time. The first one was made in 07 so the graphics and controls are janky as hell and didn&#39;t age well but the story is damn near perfection. The second game so far is my favorite graphically cause it a major upgrade from the first and the story is still great but the first imo is still better cause of how much Witcher Lore I learned in the first game. Im about to start the complete edition of the third game now but your review came up almost immediately after I turned on my PS4 so I wanted to hear your thoughts lol. If you want to read the books and play the games I would read the books first cause the games take place after the book series. The games wont spoil too much since the events in the Netflix series are mentioned in both games but there are characters that haven&#39;t been shown or explained yet if you haven&#39;t read the books so that would be the only issue. Regardless I recommend you do both if you have time cause this world might be the coolest fantasy world i&#39;ve been introduced to since Lord Of The Rings imo.
I know that the games really dont connect very well. The first season is great but is kinda all over the place with locations and story. And I dont know if it was just the director wanting to be a bit pretentious.
I think you would have enjoyed it more if you knew the time jumps ahead of time. the show runner said she was influenced by Christopher Nolan and Dunkirk.
Don&#39;t bother with the games.<br>They&#39;re shit.
PLAY THE WITCHER GAME NOW!!!!!!
so when is witcher 3 review
The series is just OK...
Always remember to toss a coin to your Witcher
The best way I‚Äôve heard Witcher‚Äôs described is ‚Äúthink of them as medieval Ghostbusters, except they take care of more than just ghosts.‚Äù
it&#39;s a bad show for people who have no idea what is a witcher and never played the games nor read the story,<br>I am one of these people and I did not like the storytelling aspect of the series.
I love this guy
Could you do a Academy Awards 2020 winner predictions?
YOU HAVEN&#39;T PLAYES THE WJICTDHDHERR!!!! REEEEE! Honestly I have all three and haven&#39;t played any yet. Didnt have time. Heard wild hunt was great.
Netflix is 2 for 2 with video game adpations and that makes me happy. I use the series as a guilty pleasure i dont know anything non surface leve about the book or games but its goofy and entertaining.
Mediocre at best.
Henry Cavill¬¥s voice is almost identical to the one in TW3. He played the game. Think he might got his inspiration from there.
Didnt love it. Damn well didnt hate it. I would not mind to keep watching it.
You get a like for finally watching this. An outstanding series imo
Watch and review fleabag
I&#39;ve been a subscriber since 2014 or something.<br><br><br>It&#39;s the 2nd time I 100% agree with you.
Loved the show! Glad i wasnt the only who didnt like the timeline! And im one one those weirdos that didnt play the games
Jeremy, play the 3rd game at least! üòÑ
I strained harder trying to figure out this timeline than i did trying to watch that dark ass game of thrones battle.
I&#39;m enjoying it and I have never played the game either. I will say that the The Mandalorian and The Witcher are my favorite shows on television at the moment.
The Witcher Games takes place after the final book in the series
Loved the series. <br><br>The flashbacks were a bit ridiculous though. I&#39;ve played all the games and i was even confused with the story at first because of all the flashbacks. Honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if people didn&#39;t realise half the show is a flashback if they had never played the games or read the books.. lol
Don‚Äôt worry Jeremy I haven‚Äôt played the games either... well not yet
What about the bard?
Henry Cavill did an amazing job with the voice just play 30 minutes of the game trust in a stranger.
I played witcher 3 two weeks before the show, and read part of the first book. It helps you to get some subtleties, like: &quot;quick, aard&quot;.
How the fuck did you not yet play at least the witcher 3 = (
Finally!!, someone who didn&#39;t play the games or read the book and came into the  franchise with brand new eyes like me ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è. I completely agree with the crazy time jumping, I swore at a point I thought I had completely skipped a few episodes in the series a few time and actually when back to the previous episode to check. Which is hilarious since Netflix&#39;s just automatically plays the next episode in the lineup, so yeah I was even second guessing Netflix&#39;s playing ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. A very enjoyable shows that I can&#39;t wait for the next season. But I have to be honest and say the final results of the first half wasn&#39;t as gratifying for me in the reunion. üòëüòë
I understand that ciri have to finde Gerald,and Jennifer wanted to become perfekt,  but what is Geralds arc
Sweet Jeremy, I have always known that you haven‚Äôt play the Witcher 3. I have asked you twice to review it. It‚Äôs fine I just highly recommend the Witcher 3 the Wild Hunt. (BTW if you decide to review the W3 and give it a poor score then you can expect pitchforks)
BRUH. where is your death stranding review üò≠üò≠üò≠
&quot;Hmmm&quot;-Geralt of Rivia
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m47s"">0:47</a> Oh no
I have played the witcher game and enjoyed dunkirks multiple timeline storytelling. This show took the best of both and mashed it together for a great series!
The games are really good. The bloody baron was a crazy quest.
Play the Witcher 3. Now.
The actress that plays yeniffer is ugly as hell. I guess they&#39;re out of hot chicks in Hollywood.
Good review my man but her name is sir-i
For me this show is more about bitcher then witcher...we need more Geralt on this show. Its like watching Tomb Raider and watch lara croft just 20% and the rest character watch more then then her.its same with witcher...
It feels like it was written for 8 year olds, if 8 year olds could watch a show with maiming and boobies.
JEREMY! GO PLAY WITCHER 3.....!!!! NOW!!!!!
You haven&#39;t played the Witcher games!? What are you, some kind of movie person who watches movies and makes videos on them?
I like the casting for most characters except for fringilla who is a hot short haired burnette in the games and worst of all triss who is a really hot ginger in the games, also with way more personality, other that yeah, I had my doubts about cavil&#39;s geralt but he did a good job, another gripe I don&#39;t understand why they keep the polish name &quot;jaskier&quot; instead of &quot;dandelion&quot;, I mean they call geralt a &quot;witcher&quot; and not &quot;wedzmin&quot; a little consistency would be nice.
This sold me on Henry Cavill. I thought he was awful as Superman but he was really good as Geralt
That dance club analogy was perfect üòÇ
<b>gasp</b> WHAT?!?!?<br><br><br><br><br>I havent played the game either. Lmao. But I did read the books just to get an idea of what to expect.
Hmm, Geralt, pitchfork, leather....Brilliant. Someone has been reading..
1.) Playing the games will not help you with this series.<br>2.) The timeline jumps are due to two factors: the series is based on a book that jumps the timeline A LOT, and the ages of Geralt and Yennefer.<br><br>Geralt (and witchers) can live centuries. Geralt himself is over 100 years old before he first meets Yennefer. He could live to be close to ONE THOUSAND YEARS. Yennefer can basically refuse to age due to her magic, keeping herself as young as she wishes...or at least slowing it down. She is about 40-60 when she meets Geralt.<br><br>Ciri is 13. That&#39;s it. That is why she gets so little time, because she is literally just started compared to a pair of near-immortals. You need the time jumps to build a history for these two ancient characters.
Thanks buddy I was on the fence till now
Yennifer is fine as fuh
The reason the show time skips is because it follows that aspect of the first book ‚Äúthe last wish‚Äù which was a series of short stories, that, at the end, formed the bigger picture to give you that ‚ÄúAh ha!‚Äù Moment
Play. The. Games. c:
Oh Jeremy thank goodness you&#39;ve uploaded!
You should do a review of Netflix&#39;s Marco Polo.  I think Henry took a lot of cues from the actor playing Genghis in that series.  He conveyed volumes with just a grunt!
No hate, no attacks, but if you find the time, I would recommend you play Witcher 3
Witcher show&lt; Witcher books&lt; Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=3m05s"">3:05</a> we must always remember that Anthony Bourdain killed himself
Please review dark on Netflix!üôèüèº...it&#39;s a must-watch
Yenefer was hoorrrible omg! &gt;_&lt;
I enjoy it
Please the review the Netflix Dracula series.
Dude play The Witcher 3 now . NOW!
I agree. As someone who read the book and played the game. One thing I DISLIKED the most from the Witcher: netflix (besides the cast of certain individuals (Trists)) was the &quot;passage of time&quot; they portrayed. It was confusing and I can understand people loosing interest off from a great series because it &quot;was confusing.&quot; The editors needs to get their stuff straighten out with visually display of the timeline. For example, a simple: &quot;12 years before; present time; 5 years after the invasion of Cintra; ETC.&quot; would have saved the frustration. One thing you don&#39;t want fail in a good series is confusing timeline.  After complaints of confusion though, Netflix has set up a timeline on the internet named: witchernetflix <br>But I still think the damage was already done.
I don&#39;t like Yennefer because of one simple reason. They told her she couldn&#39;t have children if she went through with the transformation yet she&#39;s being a bitch to everyone who&#39;s just trying to be nice to her because she.... didn&#39;t know the cost...? What the fuck?
I‚Äôve barely touched the 3rd game, which I‚Äôve had a really hard time getting into. I also never cared for Game of Thrones. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why everyone liked the show so much. There was extremely rarely anything interesting happening and for the most part it was just politics and people walking around spouting Ye Olde English for Beginners when they weren‚Äôt having sex (and sometimes when they were). I‚Äôve now seen about half of The Witcher and I‚Äôve already thoroughly enjoyed it FAR more than any episode of GoT. It makes me want to pick the third game back up and give it another shot.
Sometimes I feel like doing what I don&#39;t think about when having so much time becomes the thing you don&#39;t really care about. Does anyone else feel this way too?
The Witcher isn&#39;t a replacement for Game of Thrones, it doesn&#39;t try to be.
Fun fact, cavill is a huge fan of the books and games do he&#39;s very passionate on playing geralt! He even bases his voice off of tje the video game geralt, it&#39;s almost identical
Pitchfork eh...
Jeremy I‚Äôm with you never played the game or read the books. I came into this series blind only knowing Henry C. But really got into the show it hooked me and I‚Äôm a fan can‚Äôt wait till Season 2!
Haven&#39;t read the books or played the games, I went into the show blind and still have no idea what the timeline was. If there was just a &quot;4 months later&quot; or caption on the transition screen it would have made the show easier to follow. I want to like it, but it was very confusing.
Loved it but like, you, I think the time jumps are the biggest flaw of the show.<br>There are many times where I did not realize we were back in the past until someone said so.<br>And sometimes an episode starts at a certain timeline, and you don&#39;t realize it until 15 minutes in which kinda disrupt the flow.<br><br>Lots of time spent wondering when they were.
Love, love, LOVE the Witcher! Can&#39;t wait bro √¶ see more*ml I we tree
Do you at least plan to play though?
Definitely try the witcher games.
It pisses me off the actresses choices for yen, triss, vilgefortz, fringila, and Istredd. You want &quot;racial inclusive&quot; that&#39;s nice, I&#39;m Latin I can&#39;t be racist because gringos have been racist to our people too long but it pisses me off the fact that they change characters that are described in the books. Vilgefortz was hot as fuck in the books, yen was a milf, triss was the only sorcerer that was young and instead they gave full Indian-African characters. It kinda breaks the immersion for me.<br>Why change them?<br>Triss was disappointing as fuck.<br>And the fight with the golden dragon? It was the most epic part of the second book and in the series was just &quot;meh&quot; same with torque the Silvan and the geralt speech to florivandiel.<br><br>Just hire Eva Green for Yen and Emma stone for Triss and the series would have been a glorious success.<br>Instead we&#39;ll... They gave us an Indian yen and an African triss.
i for one didnt dig the characters in the show.. dont think they read the books or they didnt care and wanted to simplify things. this show took way too many plot lines for such low episode count. this is more style over substance.. characters are bit black and white in the show unlike the books or games. the whole mage school arc is nonsense too and they jump around too much to care much about anyone.  i thought it was not bad.. but no where close to 10/10 must watch show.  they should have left ciri plot line for season 2 and focused just on geralt and yenn this season and setup the world better instead of cramming everything into such short season.
It was nice... a nice try that is. Compared to the books, games and heck even some fanfiction makes you wonder about the choices made. In the end it tuned me out.
Finally! What took you so long mate? Its a very binge-able show tbh, most of us saw the 8 in one sitting on a sad sunday afternoon.
Jeremy play Witcher 3 darn it.
Played the games and read the books. So I was a huge fan before the show came out. Great show!
Fuck.<br>-Geralt
I love that Toss a Coin to Your Witcher became a hit song for no reason.
Pitchforks??! Too soon jeremy too soon<br>*Cries profusely
Finally!
Havent played the game, read the books. I would say overall that those who have read the books won&#39;t be able to enjoy the series as much as those whom have not. Some characters behave a little bit differently from hoe they are portrayed in the books. Some story were skipped, some story rushed or badly directed but the true MVP of the series is Henry!
i liked it enough to search a recap of the first 2 games and buy the third one
Haven&#39;t played the games? what the hell? that&#39;s pretty fine actually, they&#39;re a pretty big time investment.
As someone who didnt play the game either if you watch it a second time you&#39;ll like it even more.
Yeah all of season one is basically premise and set up for most of the story.
The three main character‚Äôs stories are all happing at different times in the beginning. I think that confused a lot of people.
Thank you for the review. Better late than never. The voice is obligatory because it comes from the games and it&#39;s iconic. This is basically a saga, so most things that didn&#39;t necessarily have a payoff in this season will have one by the end of the overarching story. Let&#39;s just hope that Netflix has money and patience and the creators talent to get us there (unlike GoT, this story is already finished in the books and games, and the ending is pretty great if you follow the games, so there shouldn&#39;t be any of that GoT season 8 nonsense this time around).
OMG you haven&#39;t played WHAT?!?!?!?!<br>You should man, it is awesome :D
This is how Assassin&#39;s Creed should&#39;ve been adapted... Sheeesh THAT disappointment
Yeah, I wasn&#39;t a fan of how they skipped around the timeline.  I understand why they did, but the really could have done it better.  I know one thing that I&#39;ve seen other shows and books do when they want to skip around the timeline is at the beginning of each episode (or book chapter), they&#39;ll have some quick prologue (usually as discussion between characters in the timeline&#39;s future) to establish where we are in the timeline.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that would have been enough however.  Frankly, they needed more episodes, or should have spread this season into two or more seasons.  They tried to cram too much here.  I had a serious WTF moment, when we went from the episode where Geralt and Yennifer first met, to the next one where she&#39;s tired of bumping into him. I had figured out the timeline by that point, but frankly that was a poor decision on their part.<br><br><br>Overall I did enjoy the show however.  Even when I was getting irritated about the timeline, I still couldn&#39;t wait to see what happened next.
If you get The Witcher 3: The complete edition. You‚Äôll probably get sucked in playing the game for a long time. Considering you got the main story missions and including two big expansion packs. Well worth it. Give it a try.
This show sucked to me I couldn&#39;t follow it and I gave up on episode 1 it was boring
I&#39;m disappointed that you didn&#39;t mention Jaskier at all. I love him to death
Anya Chalotra could read the ingredients off of a hemorrhoid treatment cream tube and I‚Äôd still be mesmerized in love üòç
It&#39;s awful. The fact that its based on books is double that. I rarely say this but books were kinda too good to even attempt to make a show of it. Aaaaand this one is a major misfire
I am soooo happy you have done a review for the Witcher
Loved this show. I read the books and the show stays pretty true to the books.
Boring story and boring characters
Yenneffer went all out on this season, this is her season, I didn&#39;t know her backstory until this show, I didn&#39;t know or expect much from Anya Chalotra but this show really made me interested what else she&#39;ll do. Ciri&#39;s timeline is really just a setup for the next season so I didn&#39;t really expect much from her arc. Geralt does &quot;the voice&quot; since he&#39;s portraying the Geralt from the game which he truly nailed, his story about trying to run away from destiny is quite prevalent on this season. This is a show that really begs for another viewing  to get all the small minor details that you didn&#39;t catch initially.
This show was bad. Great actors but bad script and some bad casting (like king Foltest). People should stop asking for new GoT.
The series better improve, I find the 1st season rushed, jumping from one scene to another, trying too hard to surprise the viewer.
Hey, random person ho scrolls to see Jeremy get roasted for not playing The Witcher games ü§£....
Not only his Henry a Video Game nerd he&#39;s a PC CHAD! Still cracks me up when the one interviewer asked &quot;Xbox or Playstation?&quot; and he answered with almost a scoff &quot;PC&quot; The correct choice!
Jermery I was in the same boat as you buddy. I watched the show with the intention to understand why everyone talked about The Witcher so much. I really wanted to get into Witcher 3 because so many people consider it to be one of the greatest games of all time. And even tho the show is more about the books I figured it would help me understand the lore better which it did. I freaking loved the show. And if you ever get the chance I HIGHLY recommend playing The Witcher 3 if you get a chance. Don&#39;t even have to play the first 2. You can just go right to 3 if you wanted it still makes sense. Honestly I bought the game the day after Christmas and I&#39;ve been playing it almost non-stop. Like this game will keep me going til season 2 comes out. I&#39;m on my 3rd play through of the main story. It one of those games that had a LOT of decision making. And you&#39;re not always gonna be happy with them and make mistakes. Which I find awesome makes to me it makes things more interesting. And it has multiple endings. Reason why I&#39;ve gone right back to the beginning of the main story is because I&#39;m trying to get the perfect ending for me. Then once that happens I&#39;ll continue with finishing all the side quests and dlcs and stuff.  Definitely wanna take your time with this one for sure and not rush through it. Because if you go too fast and forget to do a mission before the past of no return your ending will change. Definitely a wonderful game and worth playing multiple times. I wanna go on to reading the books as well. I love these characters and the world they live in. I can&#39;t wait for season 2.
Every time he paused to then say &quot;hmm&quot; or &quot;Fuck!&quot; Felt exactly like the games when you have to pick between dialogues that will forever change the story line lol
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=4m09s"">4:09</a> well yeah, ciri needs to grow up and pick a class before she can join the party
Anyone else liked Renfri? she stood out right away to me.
I haven&#39;t played the games either
YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE WITCHER 3 GAME?!
What the fuck nigga you never played the games I‚Äôm just sad for you, bruh you‚Äôd love them do yourself a favor a play them. Actually scratch that I know the love 2 and 3 the first one is what the fuck this was not worth a dollar
for clarification: cronologically all the games are sequels to the books.
I came here to see you talk about Jaskir. I stayed for a good review. Keep it up!
i just wish the show spends more time on Geralt and Ciri ( like in the book they actually met when Ciri was younger ), rather than on Yennefer
Am I the only one who fucking hated this show ..... Well I did , I mean even if we compare this season to first season of game of thrones its no where Chile plus as a fan of games and books this session just seemed to have the bad writing and the cgi like that of dragons was fucking horrible , well those are my thoughts . You might like this season but I did not in any way ....
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=1m00s"">1:00</a> me neither. I liked it, despite the pathetic attempt at a Pulp Fiction style timeline, and the forced diversity roles. Other than that, it&#39;s a decent enough show. I&#39;ll continue watching it
I am completely lost on this review
I came at this show cautiously because I‚Äôve got about 500hours in Witcher 3.. but They did a good job
The witcher 3 is on sale. On the ps store, buy It is grate. Firdt timer too, dindnt play 1 and 2 and you dont need
So <br>Awesomtacular?<br>Buy it on blue ray?<br>Good time no alcoholic required?
It stills is a bit slow and boring for me. I guess this genre the best is and has always been the Hoobit/LOTR books, cartoons, and movies.
Read the books Jeremy.
How did you not mention the combat, it&#39;s some of the best showen on tv imo
I didn&#39;t like the part where geralt and yenniffer have sex on the back of a stuffed unicorn. seemed out of place in this universe. üòâ
&quot;Witcher&quot; is like &quot;Hobbit&quot; movie, enjoyable but far from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; masterpiece. Too far from books and games, but that&#39;s for someone who read books and played games :)
You have got to play witcher 3 dawg are you insane
Man! The music suckssssss
Overall I though the series was good but not great, so I‚Äôm hoping Season 2 will build on the best parts of this season.
The Witcher 3 game is one of the best out there, fact. However, this woke trash from Netflix was an insult to the lore, and its loyal fans. It is the antithesis of woke trash, and I will not be investing any more of my time with it üò∑ The Witcher 4 is most welcome though.
&quot;We all know of Yennifer.&quot; <br>Why did he say this? It almost seems like he was implying that she was in a porno.
No comments on Jaskier? I am not tossing a coin to you Jeremey
Ummm Fuuck!!!ü§™ü§™ü§™
They&#39;ll probably do some jump scenes in the second season but it probably won&#39;t be like the first since Ciri found Geralt. Now they should be off to Kear Morhen soon, to train her to fight and we can finally meet Uncle Vesemir. ‚ù§ Papa Ves! Got to say I 100% Choose The Witcher 3 over the entire Game of Thrones series. I just hope the show can capture the greatness of the books and since they got a high score from audience, perhaps season 2 will have a bigger budget.
That&#39;s late
Oh man play the 3rd one of you can, it&#39;s Soooo good!
Netflix is bigger than Disney studios
Never read the books, never played the games. My experience  was similar to yours. The first episode I was like &quot;ok, that happened&quot;. Kept watching and had that same turn of interest. Yennefer was the most intriguing story. And really it shows your outsides don&#39;t change your insides if you are broken or feeling empty/loss.
Jeremy I live near Seattle and I will GIVE you a copy of Witcher 3. How have you not played this game! I never even played the first 2 and it was still one of the best games of all time.
How dare you
People are saying Jeremy should play the game, but as someone who played the game extensively, I‚Äôm 99% sure there‚Äôs a spoiler on how the books end. So, if Jeremy or anyone else in this comment section is going to play the game, remember this. <br><br>It‚Äôs really good though. Was my GOTY and personal game of the decade.<br><br><br>Oh, and the developers of the Witcher 3 are making a Cyberpunk RPG. Look into that.
Still havent finished Witcher 3 but I have watched the series twice now.  Things definitely feel smoother if you know the timelines while watching.   Loved the show though both times and looking forward to a more cohesive storyline in the second season.
So no rating? From I what I can tell Jeremy would rank it &quot;Great time, no alcohol required&quot;
The show‚Äôs passage of time is completely understandable if you‚Äôve read the books.<br><br>I get how it‚Äôd be confusing if ya haven‚Äôt read them.<br><br>I haven‚Äôt played the games either. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That 4th wedding episode too weird for me. That&#39;s when I stopped watching
I havent played it as well .. but I have seen stuff about it .. thanks for reading
I‚Äôve only seen the first episode because I was visiting my family for the holidays when this show came out and decided it wasn‚Äôt right to watch with them. <br><br>That being said, I applaud Henry Cavill for doing very well as Geralt, but I desperately wanted Zach McGowan to get the part. That guy looks and sounds exactly like what you‚Äôd expect of a real life Geralt and he really wanted it, too. Now, Cavill represents the real life Geralt - and he‚Äôs great at it - but I‚Äôm still sad that it didn‚Äôt go to McGowan.<br><br>Jeremy, you should at least watch a good walkthrough of The Witcher 3 if you‚Äôre not going to play it. Even though the show draws from the books for storytelling, its humor, charm, and inspiration for Geralt are derived from the game.
Play the games Jeremy Johns
Honestly I hated Yennefer. She doesn&#39;t act like Yen in the books or the game. <br>They tried to make her much more sympathetic and vulnerable and emotional. She should be witty, have a superiority complex, and be very confident and composed. They made her character and development thereof much more generic and honestly boring compared to the complexity of the source material.<br>The show overall was a mixed bag. The end and the beginning were weak but the middle had some good stuff. They have a lot to work on but there&#39;s some good stuff to build on if they&#39;re very open to criticism and making a lot of changes. I&#39;m looking forward to season 2 but I really hope the writing for Yen and how she carries herself overall changes. <br>Fingers crossed the show keeps getting better from here
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m50s"">0:50</a> ironic, given how the books ended.
The only game most people would play when they want to play the witcher for the first time is the 3rd one and the story arc is after all the events of the books. So it&#39;s nice to see the references to the characters but dont expect the show to be like the game for a long time
The non linear way the story is told reminded me of Westworld.
Jeremy a lot of the time issues is because eventually Geralt loses his memory of everything what happened so the story will be all over the place I think once season 2 starts we will see him waking up and not remembering jack...
Ginger&#39;s have souls!
Toss a Witcher 3 game to your Jeremy, oh valley of plenty.
I played the game and cried like a bitch when she found him.
Didn‚Äôt know anything about Witcher, loved it since episode 1, binged it all as soon as possible. Loved it. Saw after it the Mandalorian, only saw until episode 5 so far, but I just don‚Äôt understand the amazingness. Ok, the baby is cute. The story is all filler so far. I‚Äôm going to to keep seeing it and try to find what everyone sees and I‚Äôm missing.
play witcher games.
Watched it, liked it. Never watched Game of Thrones past season 1
Not played the games, watched the show really loved it and am now currently playing the Witcher 3... if anything it‚Äôs a great marketing tool because I‚Äôm waiting on the books from amazon too!
I love that you called Henry Cavill a snacc (pronounced exactly like that). I agree, of course
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m46s"">0:46</a> <br>Dude, major spoilers...
Well about friggin time
That &#39;mmmmm fuck&#39; was spot on
WItcher 3 is best game ever made. First witcher game doesnt hold up at all tho, just play Witcher 3, its totally your kind of game Jeremy, trust me on this, its a masterpiece. First 2 books is collection of short stories, its actually interesting to read for inspiring writers in my opinion, Andrzej obviously was just writting stuff, there wasnt much plot but it was tutorial for a writer, book 3 is where plot picks up.
Triss&#39; character is a different race to the games lmao
Jeremy hasn&#39;t played the witcher game! STONE HIM STONE HIM STONE HIM! or should I say &quot;SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!&quot;
I like how he got witcher review without mentioning joey bates as jaskier
I was disappointed with how they showed the destruction of princess Ciri‚Äôs magic AFTER she did it only. Other than that, I‚Äôm hooked.
At least the whole time thing won&#39;t be a problem in future seasons, I imagine. Since they did it like this for S1 to introduce everyone&#39;s origin. Now that they all know each other, no need to jump in the timeline, unless for flashbacks here and there for Geralt&#39;s backstory probably.
Haha you haven&#39;t played the games but that bit about pitchforks, man you gotta play it, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the best games of this generation
I wanted to see Henry‚Äôs bath scene. Yeah.... that was what got me.
Glad to see you still enjoyed it not having played the games. But seriously next time you got some free time and are looking for a good rpg....play witcher 3.
You never mentioned Jaskier or the music... for shame Jeremy :(
Right, i dont care if we dont get reveiws for a month so do yourself that favour, go buy the witcher 2 and 3, play them and reveiw the if you wish but still you need to play them you owe that awesomeness for yourself......... what are you doing still reading this Jeremy GO BLOODY PLAY THEM NOW!!!!! lol
Hey Jeremy, Big fan of your reviews. Could you please review the Watchmen series. Looking forward to it.
well not gonna attack you for not playing but you really should specially the assasin of kings yeah the graphics are a bit old but a great story
Henrey is mimicing the voice in the game. Glad your enjoying Yennefer, I have a problem with her because of the game, she just comes off bratty compared to the game version.
About tamn dime
amazing acting good storytelling Henry Cavill was a perfect Geralt this may be his defining role. Anya Chalotra stole the show as Yennefer in my opinion but I have to give the show so far a 2/10 know why? nobodys playing GWENT!!!!!!!!  GRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!! but the only thing that bugged me about Yen is that her desire to be transformed thingy dod was from a desire to be beautiful. okay understandable she mentions her body and face and twisted spine, but the twisted spine isnt a cosmetic thing. thats scoliosis which is a debilitating agonizing condition if left untreated and in her case was clearly extreme Id have thought her perspetive would be &quot;make me beautiful yes but fix my frigging back because FAAARRKKK that shit hurts.&quot;
What the fuk is a witcher
Go play the games, they are worth it.
Thank you Jeremy for being the only movie/TV show reviewer that relate with me cause every reviewer I saw knew everything bout the Witcher. I was also so confused about the Witcher when I start watching it since I never play the game nor read the book, I mean I know who Yennefer nd Geralt of rivia are and little bit about Ciri but when it comes to the story I didn&#39;t know much bout it which throw me off but after like 3 episodes or so I understood most of the story and tried to put pieces together throughout the episodes which I was relived bout lol.
Jeremy hasn&#39;t played the games!üò±ü§Ø
Anya Cholatra will be regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world very soon. And she&#39;s 23 but looks 33
Jeremy, I want to tell you to play the Witcher 3, but then I fear we wouldn‚Äôt get a video from you for a solid 2 months. <br><br>I‚Äôm doing another play through because the Netflix series got me hyped, and I‚Äôm about 40 hours in now and I‚Äôm nowhere near done the main quest, let alone the crazy amount of side quests and DLC. (For my fellow Witcher 3 homies, I haven‚Äôt gotten to Skellige...)
FINALLY
Your hair looks like a nest.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if leather blocks pitchforks, but I gotta protect myself&quot;<br>Oh the irony XD<br>This comment is brought to you by &quot;read the books&quot; gang
I unsubscribed long ago but this idiot keeps coming up on my feed _what does it take to get rid of you your like a virus
Cavill really sounds like Witcher from games.
am I the only one who think the witcher is my merlin fix sorta and not a GoT fix...also I wasn&#39;t to keen with GoT
leather doesn&#39;t provide protection from pitchforks, Geralt died wearing one
Lmao! She CAN teleport. ;)
shame
With Jeremy here <br>I haven‚Äôt played the Witcher either <br>I just put it off so I can play the first 2 <br>But then everyone told me to fuck the first 2 and just play this one
You owe it too yourself to play The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt it&#39;s absolutely stunning
First 2 episodes I didn‚Äôt know what the fuck was going on and I‚Äôve played a games and read a few books lol
I really wanted to like the show but the acting (other than caville) was so so <b><i>p o o r</i></b>
Haven&#39;t played it either, I hate the continent.. So dumb, great show though
Not a hateful comment, just a recommendation.<br>Play the games, they are great
So I don&#39;t hate you for not playing the witcher games...but you should play the witcher games (especially the 3rd game, it is amaze-balls)
Go play Witcher 3.. asap.
Jeremy hasn&#39;t played the games!? mmmhm, Fuck!
I honestly didn&#39;t know there were differing timelines until episode 4 lol
Be honest, you liked Yennifer because of ... Boobs!
That‚Äôs exactly how Siri is in the games too üòÇ<br><br><br><br><br>GOD DAMMIT SIRI ILL GET TO YOUR QUESTS AFTER I PLAY GWENT!
You haven‚Äôt played the game!?!?! How the hell...can you be exactly like me.
I&#39;ve not played the Witcher 3 either. I&#39;ve only played the Witcher 1.<br>*Witcher fandom*: we&#39;re confused.
How about a See-season 1 review, Jeremy?  It&#39;s the Jason Mamoa show on Apple tv.
I&#39;m there with you, I also have never played The Witcher. However, I enjoyed  the series all the same. It took me a bit to be oriented with the time jumping (they could have placed a date or something). I enjoyed the characters as they were slowly introduced in the season, more than that it left me wanting to know more of the lore and of the things that go on in that world. Anyway, that magic/battle scene was epic.
So are you gonna talk about MR. ROBOT ???
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who really liked how they handled the jump back and forth in time. The show doesn‚Äôt hold your hand with it it wants you to actually pay attention. It gives you these clues throughout the first 2-3 episodes and by then you figure it out and it makes you feel clever. <br><br>And the way the show is done when you do figure that out even if it takes a bit you don‚Äôt feel like you need to go back and rewatch episodes with that new info because the stories are segmented enough at that point that you‚Äôll be fine. And then soon after it starts to interweave the storylines in interesting ways. <br><br>It‚Äôs just a really smart way of storytelling imo that neither confuses the audience or holds their hand along the way as long as you really pay attention. It should be obvious from the start that this isn‚Äôt a turn your brain off casually watch kind of show
Favorite characters: Geralt, Yennefer and Jaskier....I have spoken
Thx
So quick rundown for yah: The Netflix series is based off of the books.  The video games take place after the books.  So, even if you&#39;d played the games you might very well still be lost :D.<br><br><br>And I have to say, having only read most of book 1, the series follows that fairly faithfully.  The jumping around is actually present there as well so we can&#39;t say it was something the show runners did on their own.<br><br><br>That aside, binged this with my brother (who has played the games but not read the books...I haven&#39;t played the games) over the Christmas holiday and we both liked it quite a bit.  I do agree that Ciri is probably the least interesting character so far but I actually liked Dandelion the best of the lot for his humor &amp; levity.
Only thing that bothers me is how quickly Yennefer and Geralt got together. That could‚Äôve been a slow burn to add another layer of intrigue.
From what I see of your taste in videogames through the month journals you really need to play at least Witcher 3. You&#39;ll love it
The timeline was confusing as F,  because they&#39;re mutants and don&#39;t age, so I had to be like &quot;Okay, what timeline are we at now.&quot; Also, Ciri and her mother look exactly alike, so that confused me, as far as the timeline goes at the beginning. I didn&#39;t care for the separate story lines, at times it was boring if I didn&#39;t care for a certain character. I would give it a 7/10. Geralt was the best part of the series for me.
Hmm<br>Hmpf<br>Fuck
Huh, might give it another go, i guess. Didn&#39;t make it through the first episode. The parts with Ciri came off as cosplay with a budget and something was a bit off about the writing in general.
I know I bugged you on Instagram about this one. If you are interested in the books they are a great read. They have the audiobooks on audible. And give Witcher 3 a shot. It‚Äôs Awesometacular.
Before anyone responds, this isn&#39;t me saying the show is bad, but that the advertising is misleading and incorrect:<br>They say the series is based off of the books, not the game. However, the episodes in the show more accurately reflect events in the game, than the books. In the show, just like the game, Geralt goes to Calanthe&#39;s ball to protect Jaskier (Dandelion). But in the books, the bard was never there, and Geralt is only there because Calanthe hired him to protect the attendees from &quot;monsters&quot;.<br><br>When Geralt meets the dragon, the events of the hunt of the dragon are what happened in the video game. In the books, Geralt never makes it to a cave per say, but the participants of the Hunt are challenged directly by the Dragon, who led them to a completely different location. And Geralt doesn&#39;t even really help fight alongside Three Jackdaws until late into the fight, unlike how it happens in the show AND the video games. <br><br>Events in the show simply reflect hwo the video games play not, NOT how the books are. Almost everything in the show, including the moment when Geralt was defeated by the ragged band of elves, AND the moment when Ciri was in Brokilone forest all reflect the events of the Witcher Video Games. I just read the book &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot; where Ciri is in Brokilone Forest, and it is <b>nothing</b> like the show. <br><br>Absolutely nothing in the tv show reflects what happens in the books, in comparison to how it was framed in the video games. None of it.
Jeremy, play the Witcher 3 what‚Äôs wrong with you?
My review of The Witcher not once did we hear &quot;Medallions humming&quot; there was a severe lack of Roach on rooftops 0/10 jk
Henry is still a snack üòÇ
With better narrative that follows a story the entire season it will do better.
I hadn&#39;t play the Witcher games too Jeremy. But this show encouraged me to play Witcher 3.<br><br>It&#39;s now my new favorite game series.
Loved the first episode but the rest was kinda boring. After seeing the sword fight and that gorgeous violence in the 1st, the rest just got boring. Would have loved to see more monsters. I have not read the books or played the game
You haven&#39;t played The Witcher? ü§£
How dare you not Play the Witcher!!! You FOOL. (Only joking Ly Jezza X)
Really good video and I love Jeremy, but not playing the games warranted the dislike. Have a good week Jeremy!
@Jeremy Jahns. Do a lets play of The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.
.........must play game then we will talk
you didn&#39;t talk about technical stuff and mainly focused on character and the only thing that you mentioned I think it was the timeline. my main problem with witcher is this story. I think right now I should protect myself too :) you and I are the same. I didn&#39;t know the witcher, I didn&#39;t play the game and I didn&#39;t reed the book just like I didn&#39;t know the Game of Thrones books but that show took you deeply and you understand the world you&#39;re watching step by step but The Witcher just threw me in a world with a lot of unknown parts. and now let talk about the finale. they brought the show on the climax and they just left it there irrationally. that to me really looked like ending of an episode, not Season and you are watching all season and they keeping them apart and at the end, you have wait 2 years for more.
Toss a coin to your (..........)
Any chance you will talk about Death Stranding?
I&#39;m with you I hadn&#39;t played the games or read the books but the show got me interested in both, us waiting for my next holiday week to run through the witcher 3 on the ps4
I havent played the Witcher either... I always thaught It was some kind of c- level Skyrim/GOW/Assassins Creed.
Hmmm...
Am I the only person that thought this show was boring and corny as hell?
Henry Cavill is such a nerd about The Witcher too. He loves the books and the video games. He actually has his own gaming room lol
Actors and Voice actors.<br>Some times people are both, it was bound to happen at some point. See them both on screen.
Best moments of the series: Bathtub Geralt plus &quot;don&#39;t judge me&quot; :D
<b>The girl in the woods will be with you always she is your destiny geralt</b>
Jeremy if you enjoy RPGS and killing things you&#39;ll enjoy the Witcher. It&#39;s obviously a highly recommended game but it will be ok if you choose not to play them.
To bad season 2 isn&#39;t coming till 2021.
Play the game<br>Play the game<br>Play the game<br><br>üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
This show was straight up Dunkirk in the most surprising way. Nolan where you at
Honestly part of Yennifer&#39;s plight didn&#39;t make sense, she blames the sorceress school for taking her ability to reproduce away, but she willingly gave it up to go through the transformation, no one forced her.
Dude when Yennifer is sold and is looking at herself in the mirror crying and tries to kill herself...I couldn‚Äôt believe how impactful that actress made that scene. Was fantastic acting and storytelling
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.........
christmas came late didn&#39;t it?
...play the games.
This show is for people who haven&#39;t read the books.
I dont feel this show, seem like something his missing
Play the games. You&#39;re welcome the games are skyrim, met game of thrones, met lord of the rings.
Witcher show was trash..
I love Jeremy and his opinionsü•∞ü•∞
I hadn‚Äôt played The Witcher games either, but watching this series made me pick up Witcher 3. The full game is only like $15 with DLC‚Äôs now. Also plan to start reading the books soon.
The only thing I did not understand in The Witcher was why Superman sounds like Batman.
Hateful comment
TOSS A COIN TO YOUR WITCHER
&quot;I havent played the witcher games&quot;<br><br><b>Bravo 6 Going Dark</b>
No need to play the first 2 games because they&#39;re kinda dated, just watch recaps on YouTube but do play the last game, it&#39;s just a good game to play and you&#39;ll enjoy the series more.
Racebending&#39;s not cool, yo.
Bring on Season 2
This show made me feel like such a dumbass like took me too damn long to figure the chronological order
I was hooked from the first episode.
Loved the show easily my top show of 2019 with Mandalorian right behind.
I haven&#39;t read the books or played the games. I just came here for Cavill&#39;s rippling torso. I stayed for Yennifer&#39;s story though, really liked the series because of her.
Who else would like to see Jeremy do a couple hour trial commentary gameplay video of the witcher 3?
Don‚Äôt worry Jeremy.... I never played the Witcher games myself
Haven&#39;t played the games? No problem.. You should react to the witcher 3 trailers.. The cinematic ones
If you read the book and play the game, you wouldn&#39;t be too confused by the timeline but you would probably wondering about the cast choice
Hateful comment!
YOOOOO
I absolutely detested Yennefer and her story line and the pacing of the show. Esp if u&#39;re used to Yen from the games. Still had a good time with it overall but those two things... Eh.
Nice review. Now please review the games or at least the 3rd one. 2 and 3 still hold up really well
Word for word the exact review I‚Äôd give. This is how you do strong female characters.
Nobody :.......<br>Literally no one :.......<br>Not a single soul :.....<br>Geralt : &quot;Hmmm&quot;
Jeremy: &quot;I haven&#39;t played The Witcher games.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Me: &quot;Fuuck.&quot;
Toss a Coin to your Witcher, dude.
The action scenes deserved some recognition in this review.
I am so disappointed with this show. For me it was opposite of your experience Jeremy. First episode was really good, that fight at the end of first episode was simply amazing. It reminded me of fight scenes in Logan, how grounded and realistic it was. However, with each episode it was just worse and worse. That dragon episode is when I was just done with the show. I watched rest just out of curiosity. Ciri was useless, she did nothing in entire season. Geralt, main character of the show, has no character development. At all. Yennefer was only character that had actual character ark. But I think even that was bad, because side characters, which Yennefer is, should not have more character development then main characters. Not in the first season. I get it after they established Geralt, then in second season you can go for Yennefer. But it looks like they want to do it other way around. But that last episode‚Ä¶ it was so bad. It was fucking terrible. Not only both Ciri and Geralt, who are suppose to be main characters are a fucking extras in last episode, but also it goes against everything they established about Yennefer. Her motivation, her character, just get fucking 180 turn around.<br><br>In short, I fucking hate this season. I will watch second one, since it is on Netflix, not like I will need to pay extra for it, but I am really not looking forward for it.<br><br>Also, games are so much better. Just first chapter in first game has more character development and more interesting story ark than this entire season.
Jeremy: &quot;I haven&#39;t played The Witcher games&quot;<br>People who only played Witcher 3: &quot;How dare you&quot;
Toss a toss to your tosser!
It&#39;s more fun watching someone who isn&#39;t familiar with the books/games reviewing the series.
As a fan of both the books and the games, this was a phenomenal adaptation. Flawed yes, but it captures the spirit of the books perfectly, and Cavill is a perfect fit for Geralt. However, the series is in a sense too faithful to the books, because it inherits a lot of the flaws in them, namely the jumpy story, confusing timeline and focusing on unnecessary elements. Ciri was a wholly unnecessary element to have in this season, focusing purely on a &quot;monster of the week&quot; formula would have been perfect for introducing the world and the characters. But bah, we gotta have the big fantasy war plot and a big prophecy and blah blah blah.<br><br><br>And Triss isn&#39;t a 11/10 redhead, so the whole series sucks donkey dick.
Can&#39;t wait for the new game and the new season
It was a good show. It has its flaws, but there‚Äôs a lot of promise there.
Loved it, the narrative of the story kind of jumped around a bit but definitely a strong debut.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=1m40s"">1:40</a> Henry is literaly trying to make an impersonation of the Geralt from the games in the TV show. He says he was very much inspired by Doug Cockle the voice actor from the games for his portrayal of Geralt.
PLAY THE WITCHER 3 FOR FFS !
the witcher 3 is 15$ on psn until 1/17/20<br>ps the show got people to play the game
I found it a bit convoluted. Passage of time &amp; the style they used with time and revisiting pieces had me confused on first watch. Some of the actors I couldn‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôd seen before or not. Like is this a new character?
How can you play so many games and not play the witcher games?
Very fair review!
Read the books (or listen to audiobooks) and play the games ;) Way better than series :P
I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games.<br><br>I&#39;m still waiting for the punchline
Yennifer can open portals, its kinda her thing.<br>Edit: Geralt hates them.
Watch &#39; Sacred Games&#39;
So when are you gonna play The Witcher 3,huh!!huh!!!
Played and loved the third game, loved the show as well.
You forgot to say if it was &quot;good time no alcohol required&quot; or &quot;awesometacular&quot; or whatever<br><br>was that done on purpose?
&quot;I haven&#39;t played the witcher games&quot;<br><b>Heresy!</b>
Am I the only one that found the Witcher awful? Horrible editing, horrible pacing, a ton of useless secondary characters that don‚Äôt affect the story, etc.
Jeremy!!!!! Play Witcher 3!!!
Thats alright, the wircher 3 wild hunt ui&#39;s will fry your brain and the combat is a little rough to say the least oh and the slightly off key cello that apparently nobody noticed, still i might give it another chance and finish it (after i graduate from &quot;wicher 3 ui intitute)
My favorite series of 2019, you can tell a lot of love when into it.
Please review Mr robot
&quot;We all know about Yennifer.&quot; I see what you did there ;)
Did Jeremy miss providing is Rating?
Do Dracula next...
This is exactly how I felt. Loved the series. It took some getting used to. I even watched it a 2nd time. Like you, I have not played the games or read the books. I just like scy-fy and fantasy type stuff. Good review!
Dude you fucking need to play the game!
Witcher 3 is on my pile of shame, but after watching the series makes me want to pick it up and start playing. Loved the series.
Perfect review. Exactly how I felt.
Cavill is surprisingly good at being Geralt. He&#39;s the best thing about the series.<br>The Nilfgaardian costumes are the worst part.
I couldn&#39;t watch it, they look nothing what they look like in the game and I just can&#39;t separate the two.
witcher 3 was overrated anyway<br><br><br><br><br><br>bracing for hate.
I really hope they release the soundtrack on Spotify, I really enjoyed it. I really liked the non-linear storyline and the puzzle pieces all falling together the final episode. It took me until the wedding episode to realize we were jumping around in time greatly. I was like ‚Äúman this queen REALLY looks like the queen from the first episo....oh‚Äù. Overall a 9/10 show for me, although I feel like they really made a misplay with the final episode focusing on Yennefer so much as opposed to Geralt. I feel like the rules and power of the mages are inconsistent throughout the show.<br><br>Regardless, excited to see more.
Best Character (ok my favorite not the best) is Jaskier. So much fun. So meta at times. But realistic about the portrayal of history. Stuff gets distorted to gain a favorable outcome depending on who is telling it.
Time passing in this show sucks,one minute the Witcher and his sidekick is together the very next scene when the talk again you realize 8months-1year has passed since they last saw eachother but for us it was the last scene and they did not hint at all they were separating,man that stuff blew my mind
Witcher üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥
Play the game Jeremy u won‚Äôt regret it
my only problem with the CGI was the dragon. i was happy with the monsters other than that and the spell effects were quite good as well as the fight choreography.
He didn&#39;t played the games, he didn&#39;t talked about Jaskier or the fight choreography and, the cardinal sin here, he didn&#39;t sing Toss a Coin to Your Witcher! What the (hmmm) fuck?! Worst review ever. I&#39;ll toss no coins to you sire, now go sink some hundreds of hours on The Witcher games.
Seriously though play witcher 3. I know you own a ps4 and the game of the year edition is on sale now and includes all DLC. Its like ¬£13 (don&#39;t know in dollars), and it almost feels like robbery with the sheer amount of quality and quantity you get
read this if you want to start the books The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski
C&#39;mon Jeremy play and review the Witcher 3
Not played the games or read the books but enjoyed it
It&#39;s funny that you mentioned pitchforks of all things  xD
Dear Americans!!!!! Siri is swahili for secret!! Hope to get that across anywhere I hear siri the Apple AI
Very poor world-building. It&#39;s OK show, but has a lot of flaws that stops it at being great.
The way everyone talks good stuff about this show... I feel like I&#39;m the only one who thinks it&#39;s not that good, it&#39;s  definitely not bad but not that good... I&#39;ve read the books but didn&#39;t like them either
Literally everything you said is exactly how I felt lmaoooo
The show isn‚Äôt in chronological order FYI
Witcher S1 was just GoT S8 with less production value. About 4-5 season&#39;s of material crammed into 8 episodes.
Without any knowledge of the series, I was lucky enough to guess by the second episode that there was some strange time and pacing stuff going on which made watching the show until that was made blatant actually bearable. Even being able to guess that, it&#39;s really obvious how its execution was really poor, especially the time-skips. Viewers will be confused if they don&#39;t pay enough attention. There shouldn&#39;t have to be throw-away lines that make the viewer certain time has passed. There should be visuals to support that and there wasn&#39;t enough. I absolutely did still enjoy the show and am looking forward to the next season, but it deserves the scores critics gave it.
the witches is so far the dumbest and most shallow series i watched, the dept of the series is equivalent to twilight.<br>and jeremy describes it like a teenage girl. Right from the first scene in ep1 you can see from the fight with the spider that the series is done badly  mean the choreography fight beatween the spider and gerald is zero. God have mercy
Watched one episode, thought pornstar had better actings.
Books and Games have their own magic, but show was quiet good, Henry definitely slayed it as Geralt of Riva!
How could you resist a round of Gwent !!
Ciri was my least favourite too, esp given how much I loved her in W3. I hope she grows a lot.<br><br>But yeah, aside from a few nitpicky complaints, the passage of time was the biggest flaw. Yen and Geralt don&#39;t physically age... but the other characters don&#39;t look to age a day despite a decade or more time passing. Ciri&#39;s &#39;grandmother&#39; looks like her mother and despite something like 10 to 15 years passing, just doesn&#39;t age at all. Ditto Jeskier, even with the throwaway line about the crow&#39;s feet.
I loved the time movement. It felt a bit like an aha moment for me. I haven&#39;t played the game but my bf has so I knew a bit of the lore. <br><br>I do have to say Henry Cavill always kills it with his characters. Yes, it takes an episode or so but once you feel him as a character he is that character. All in all, loved the show, want more of it and hope we get 8 GOOD seasons of it.
I would like love it if you did a review or a series of reviews on &quot;The Expanse&quot;.
He didn&#39;t mention &quot;Toss a coin to your Witcher.&quot; I am disappoint.
I want a show called The Whitcher about a guy who can&#39;t make decisions.
You could only like this show if you havent read the books. <br><br>1-  It horribly fucked up the following characters: Jaskier, Calanthe, Triss, Cahir (the most fucked in my opinion), Foltest, Fringilla and Vilgefortz, and Ciri was on the verge of getting fucked, but there is still time to save her. <br>2- It should be called &quot;The Adventures of Yennefer (and a witcher shows up sometimes)&quot;, seriously, who&#39;s idea was to make Yennefer the protagonist?<br>3- It diverged so much from the books they pretty much were just writing fanfiction. Their excuse to every criticism of &quot;its based on the books not the games&quot; its really ridiculous now.<br>4- Why is a world based on medieval eastern europe , with slavic folklore based stories so ethnically diverse? I mean, black elves and dwarves? How does that make sense? <br><br>So, yes, this show kinda sucked. Not as much as i thought it would, oddly enough.
Trust me<br>Just skip to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=01m33s"">01:33</a><br>&quot;He talks like this all the time&quot;
...Jeremy, you are a video game ethusiast who LOVES RPGS. How have you NOT played the Witcher. I&#39;m embarrassed, I&quot;m switching to Struckmann
Does the end of the video look dubbed over to anyone else? Maybe it‚Äôs just me
Gaaaaa!! Stop what your doing and go play them!!
If you&#39;re salivating for more Witcher, good news, you have a 50+ hour game to look forward to.
Even game of thrones had to build, that&#39;s why the last seasons are awful they didn&#39;t put in the time
THIS IS A HATEFUL COMMENT THAT WILL MAKE ME GO BLIND
No rating on this? Did I miss something lol
This guy is such a fraud why do you listen to these biased lies
The show got a 4/10 for me, because it lacked something EXTREMELY crucial.<br><br><br><br><br>Geralt playing Gwent.
&quot;We all know of Yennefer&quot; hMmMmmmMmmm
If you liked yennefer, go watch bojack horseman
Netflix Witcher was a massive waste of time. All the short stories from the books are hacked and cut down to the point where there is no moral or even sense in them anymore. This is not an adaptation, it&#39;s a hack job.
I agree with you on the passage of time aspect of the series, I think that&#39;s basically the only thing they should&#39;ve done better (being a big fan of the books helped me keep track, though)
Within 40 seconds&#39; &quot;I don&#39;t know much about Witchers&quot;... that&#39;s after finishing the series... which tells you how fucking horrible the character development was. What do we know about our protagonist after a season? hmmmm and fuck... that&#39;s about it.
search youtube for the WItcher 3&#39;s opening cinema, and you&#39;ll how Yennifer became beautiful. and, if you read the books, the game is not necessary...
So in this video I learned that Jeremy:<br>1- Never played a Witcher game<br>2- Is an Apple user
Honestly play Witcher 3  it&#39;s one of the best games ever
The actress playing Yennifer looks just like the youtuber &#39;That Star Wars Girl&#39;, Anna.
S1 covers books 1 which is a collection of stories so yea it can be a bit disjointed but it will def get better as it will prob be more cohesive from now on.<br>No judgment Jeremy, I read the books then watched the show and now am finally getting to Witcher 3. That may be the best order imo
I hadn&#39;t played the games or read the books before watching, and I loved it. I will admit it took me a second watch-through before everything really sunk in, but I would rather that than have the show spoon-feed me or hit me over the head with everything. I do think it&#39;s time to stop with the Game Of Thrones comparisons, though. Aside from them both being fantasy stories with a healthy does of TV-MA content, they&#39;re very different shows.
If you played the games youll love this series
Pitchforks, heh...<br><br>Jeremy, look up Youtube videos that tell you what happens in the first two Witcher games, then get The Witcher 3 on the PS Store ASAP! The Game of the Year Edition is on sale with 70% off. The game is fucking amazing. Get it before the promotion is done!
I thought Henry Cavill sounded    like how game characters react. So I kind of get the voice...<br><br>The actions were really good too.
It&#39;s funny when the cast was first shown, yennefer was the casting fans had the &quot;biggest&quot; issue with. Now she&#39;s one of the standouts....killed it
This proves without a shadow of a doubt that Grace was wrong asf about Cavill&#39;s acting. He was never the problem with Superman. It was WB.<br>Toss a coin to the actor.
Haven&#39;t seen the series and won&#39;t see them. I&#39;m not supporting backwashing just to please some American SJWs on Twitter. They keep ruining films and series and I&#39;ll keep withholding my money from those films and series.
Feel like you‚Äôre sucking it off a little too hard there mate. It was ok, nothing compared to the books, and kinda solid compared to the games but it was an average to good series overall.
So yeah...if you could go and play Witcher games..that be great..
You are very lucky not to have played the witcher 3 cause you still can do it! Best video game ever!
I‚Äôd say Jeremy should play Witcher 3 but we wouldn‚Äôt get a review for like 2 years, so I‚Äôll just tell all commenters who also haven‚Äôt played it to do so. It‚Äôs great
The neat thing about Cavil‚Äôs voice, the character of Geralt is actually ‚Äúfaking‚Äù or adopting an accent (but kinda unsuccessfully). The Witcher school he comes from all have American accents in the games, and Cavil is adopting aspects of Geralt‚Äôs voice from the games (according to him). But at the same time Geralt in the books is trying to do a Rivian accent (he isn‚Äôt from Rivia, despite the name).<br><br>Also, in broad strokes, Yennifer‚Äôs story has a lot of detail made up for the show, and it‚Äôs clear that she is the showrunner‚Äôs favourite character lol.
No Jaskier love huh?
Let&#39;s be honest it&#39;s shit
So... Pasage of time was bad huh? Kind of like jump cuts. üòÇ
Check out my thoughts on Witcher and sign the petition for Henry Cavill and Keanu Reeves
Loved it!!!  I enjoyed how appropriately they explained the mechanics of how Magick works.  The storytelling was genius since it helped understand the key characters as well as the socio-political environment.  Then again I‚Äôm a fan of the books and the video games.  So I kinda know why it was important to tell the story the way they did.  We are in for an amazing and inspiring story.  Give it time to develop and you‚Äôll be amazed at the depth evolution and fun situations our characters will go through.
I really enjoyed this show. <br>I was not a fan of the games but I was a fan of the first couple collections of short stories this series is based on so I was very happy to see those stories adapted well.
I really enjoyed the Netflix adaptation of Jerry of Riverdale.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m49s"">0:49</a> funny that Geralt basically dies in the games by a pitchfork...
Witchers are basically humans who have undergone modifications to inherit abilities like agility, immunity and all the good stuff. They also have extremely heightened senses, which means they can hear, see and smell things normal people cannot. They can also perform simple magic like Aard, the force push, Quen, a protective shield, Ingi, to light things on fire...They&#39;re also taught to make and consume potions, which provides them with certain specific benefits. Witcher potion is highly dangerous to normal people. Hell it&#39;s even dangerous for witcher themselves. The toxicity from the potions cause their skin to go pale and their eye to go COMPLETELY black, improving their senses even further. <br>They undergo certain trials called The Trial of the Grasses to become a witcjer, and only 3 out of 10 boys survive the trials. Geralt, eskel and Lambert (other witchers, GREAT characters) survived the trials. But geralt was the only one in a long time who was qualified for future trials. He was put through  extended trials, which turned his hair and skin pale. <br>Vesemir is the mentor of Karr Morhen, The School of the Wolf. There are other schools, like School of the Viper, School of the Bear, School of the Cat.
YOU HAVENT PLAYED THE GAMES!!!!! HERSEY!!!!!! PLAY THE WILD HUNT!
I could swear I saw the Witcher 3 wild hunt on your channel. Lol. &#39;Put the keyboard down&#39;
You should review THE EXPANSE
Toss a coin to Jeremy
Jeremy rocking Alex Turner&#39;s hair is everything
CDPR did it better.
Play the witcher 3 now and you will know the rest of the shows storyline.<br>And its fun. Lots and lots of fun.
no mention of jaskier. he was my favourite character in the series. whenever he was on screen he made me laugh! toss a coin to your witcher!
felt the same way about the time jumping.. some text showing the year would be nice......
My favorite scene had to be when they started in the bar with the random dude saying Geralt was dead and Jask is just calmly taking notes while telling him that he&#39;ll be back later. Kid had some of the best scenes even if he got a little annoying at times!
it was so cheesy and yet so enjoyable to watch, also if you  haven‚Äôt Played the Witcher 3 you haven‚Äôt had a full PS4 experience.
@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=1m00s"">1:00</a> JEREM! BLASPHEMY! No, seriously, you should. It&#39;s one of the best RPGs out there. On par with Zelda <b>wink wink</b>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather blocks pitchforks‚Äù<br><br><br>You‚Äôre about to find out
The core element of Game of Thrones is Human Politics . The fantasy in GoT just for the garnishing purpose, where The Witcher is totally opposite. Better not to mix them up. But i agree they need to develop the characters and improve technical aspects.
They definitely should show Gwent just 1 time.
Jeremy hasn&#39;t play the witcher? You would it would be one of his favorites
Henry Cavill should have played rhaegar in game of thrones
I wasn&#39;t sure about The Witcher, and almost stopped at episode 3. Then, I came back to it a few days later and got hooked and binge watched it to the end. I don&#39;t know if it was the amazing acting from almost everyone or the general charm, but it turned out to be a worthwhile experience in the end.
Oooww boyyy you played mass effect but not witcher.. ooww boyyy you better start playing now till next season comes! COME ON! üòÇ
It&#39;s about damn time Jeremy
Well, if you thought Yennefer and Geralt&#39;s stories were distant from Cirilla&#39;s.... You won&#39;t be looking forward to reading the books.üòÖ
I love that club comparison üòÇ <br><br><br>PS Try out the game Jeremy üòâ
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been said to you several times, but seeing how much you enjoy gaming and the kinds of games you tend to enjoy, I really would recommend Witcher 3. Seems right up your alley.
TOSS A COOOIN TO YOUR WITCHER!
I&#39;ll one up you, I haven&#39;t played Witcher 3 and I&#39;m from the country from where the story originates
Play the games. It‚Äôs great.
How dare you not have played Witcher 3 reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I haven&#39;t played the games or read the books<br>But I enjoyed the show<br>Now I want to play all 3 games and read atleast the first book
It could have been game of thrones at its peak, but the writers decided to not follow the books and fuck every character they touched. Complete dogshit show
I would have liked to see more Witchering from Geralt. I don&#39;t think they really explained much about silver hurting things or etc. In the books and games a Witcher is like a badass exterminator, and they figure out what they are fighting and prepare for it before they ever go to fight it. I think that is why the Striga episode was my favorite, because it was just pure, core being a witcher.
I think that if you played The Witcher games and read some of the Witcher books, you would have enjoyed it more. Also, Europians have much closer and deeper relationship with these characters and plot lines so I understand why are you lost in storytelling.
Wait theres a book?
Finaly!!!!!!
Funny you mention pitchforks: one of the iconic Witcher characters gets killed with a pitchfork. At least in the books.
&quot;I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games&quot; No pitchforks man I&#39;m actually jealous that you&#39;re yet to experience the brilliance
Toss a like to your witcher
Please at least play the last two witcher games and like when it comes to three at least just do the main quest on story and sword like it&#39;s so fucking good and makes you appreciate the tv show so much more like I was flipping my shit when I saw him use ard the first time
<b>Hmmmmmm fuck</b>
ah yes the OG leather jacket
Too late!
Toss a coin to Jeremy
Heh pitchforks
No one:<br>Absolutely no one:<br>Ceri finding random man in woods: Geralt!
Yennefer definitely stole the show, there were times I told the whole series was about her and not the witcher.
The author of the books says Henry Cavill is the perfect embodiment of Geralt.
Lol the monsters were practically
Finished watching it on the weekend. Loved it. Can&#39;t wait for season two. They finally did a proper adaptation of a video game into a movie or TV show format that doesn&#39;t suck ass
How on earth does a known gamer never played the witcher 3.. How?
6/10 - just slightly above average show - really bad narrative, tolerance syndrome, feminist shit everywhere, unlikable characters without any smart motivation...and so on and so on and so on <br><br><br>if you call this &quot;Witcher&quot; a great experience - you know nothing about movies
Fun fact: Geralt originally wanted to be called &quot;Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde&quot; instead of &quot;Geralt of Rivia&quot; but his mentor told him that&#39;s stupid.
Don&#39;t play the witcher 3, it leaves you with a sad hollow feeling when you beat the game... As if you just lost a friend
HAVEN&#39;T PLAYED THE WITCHER GAMES?! Hersey!<br><br>Nah it&#39;s whatever but you&#39;d love the games.
I sold the Witcher 3 because I got bored üò¨ - I liked the concepts, just not the gameplay. Lol I perhaps think it‚Äôs because you have to think too much üòÇ
They butchered the witcher books. So &quot;Pox On It&quot;. :)
Dis series was a mess
I feel like Roach did a good job portraying his character.
I‚Äôm halfway through and I‚Äôm not really looking forward to finishing. I just am not enjoying it very much, the time jumps are so jarring
Just look up some comparison videos to Cavill vs the Witcher voice actor (there are some videos where they say the exact same lines) and you can hear how he&#39;s just imitating the voice actor from the games. He&#39;s soooooooooooooo good!
For a person who reviews movies, he&#39;s missed out a lot
&quot;... I haven&#39;t played the witcher games&quot;<br>Tony... Bring the pitchfork
You never played Witcher 3? Well, I envy you because I&#39;ll never again experience this game for the first time
Spoiler talk vid?
I just finished watching it and here you are lol<br>Perfect timing
I didnt have a problem with you not playing the games UNTIL you called ciri princess princess.... HOW THE FUCK DARE YOU NOT PLAY THE GAME (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª<br>GO PLAY IT NAO (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª<br>also, side note, play the outer worlds, you&#39;ll get some firefly feels
I want to like this....but I swear I&#39;m so damn tired of gratuitous nudity for the sake of it. Like purposely strategically hiding male nudity but overemphasizing female nudity makes no sense. <br>I hope that the storytelling structure pays off because it just feels like disjointed episodes with no clear through line to keep going. Cavill is great though.
I would argue that &quot;passage of time is one of the shows flaws&quot; isn&#39;t really a flaw. Its apparent when watching the show that that moment to moment passage of time doesn&#39;t mean anything when you&#39;ve got characters that age slowly and exist in different time periods. The show doesn&#39;t care about time Jeremy, you do, so its not the show&#39;s fault for not delving into that.<br><br>Also, PLEASE don&#39;t pigeonhole this in with Game of Thrones, just because its a fantasy series. Not all sci-fi is Star Wars or Star Trek and not all fantasy is Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones.
If you played the Witcher 3 you‚Äôll love the show even more.
Jeremy: &quot;Pitchforks&quot; <br>The entire witcher fandom: why did you say that name?
Couldn&#39;t get pass the first episode. It was horrible
<b>picks up pitchfork</b><br><br><br>&quot;dam it he&#39;s wearing leather, pack it up boys we&#39;ll get him next time&quot;
this was hard to watch
I&#39;m so relieved. As a book fan and game fan, I felt like the show couldn&#39;t escape the shadow of the versions I already loved. But if people who are new to the Witcher really like the series, then I&#39;m happy. Nevertheless, I liked the episodes, and I&#39;m glad Jeremy did too.
Its a good show but if you not played the game or read the books it can be somewhat confusing
Yea Beauty and power is only cool for probs a hundred years or so and than it‚Äôs just boring lol
Lets see a review of The Expanse...aka Game of Thrones (season 1 thru 6) in space!
I liked this series in the end but there&#39;s a lot of screaming which makes me say &quot;Hey, c&#39;mon... What happened to suffering I  silence?&quot; as I remove my headphones or lowering the volume. And the flashbacks are not done too well. It jumps dramatically sometimes so much so that if you&#39;re not actively watching you&#39;re going to have to start over.
Why is it called the Witcher ? Witcher is a co star in his show.
Yes yen is awesome. And there def needs to be better sign posting for peasants like you who don&#39;t know any of the lore
Toss a Coin to the Witcher got me hooked to the series
Oh boy you are missing out on one epic game better late than never jeremy.
It&#39;s funny you say you&#39;d like to see more of Geralt&#39;s back story. As someone whose only known anything about the world of The Witcher is through The Witcher 3, this for me is the back story, this is the origins. But then for someone with no knowledge on the stuff, it&#39;s funny to see that they want to have backstory/origins as well. Perhaps that&#39;s testament  to how interesting the world/characters are.<br><br>As for Ciri, her story is definitely more entertaining and interesting having played The Witcher 3 as again it is the origins story, but I never thought about her story with the context of it being the only information known about the story, so I could see why it&#39;d feel perhaps disjointed.<br><br>Anyway, I love the series so far. Now I just need more.
Play the games man! They will clarify a thing or two. You can skip the first one, cuz&#39; the game play is not for everyone, but it is a great story, read it if you can! The second game is much more refined you gonna love it! The Witcher 3 is arguably one of the most epic RPG ever made, it&#39;s AWESOME,! Great video!
Well, I bet Jeremy&#39;s hair is a fan of the Witcher.
Witcher game live-streams or play through please ‚ù§Ô∏è
Jeremy... Please play Witcher 3. Forget the other two games. Just play 3. Please. You wont regret it
ü™ìü™ì‚öîÔ∏èüç¥üî™üî™
I never played them either ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I just started playing the witcher 3 game today so you&#39;re not alone
The show actually has different timelines which is why the time element seems confusing at some points. I didn&#39;t notice it at the beginning as well.
This comment section is basically gamingcirclejerk
Just play the Witcher 3
Me: Waiting for Jeremy to comment on Jaskier...<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Still waiting.
U should try Playing Witcher 3.. It&#39;s a Pretty good Game
<b><i>H A T E F U L  C O M M E N T</i></b>
I was hooked from the first episode. When Geralt says something to the effect of &quot;Lesser. Greater. Middling. Evil is evil. If I have to choose one over the other, then I choose neither.&quot; And boom, went the brain in my head. Watched the whole season the following day. Not expecting another season until 2021. But I am salivating for more.
Jeremy the Witcher 3 is legitimately one of th best games ever. You would absolutely love it!
What happened to your Death Stranding review?
Loved the show, but they needed to address the timeline better, I was confused a lot thinking that we were in the present, but then come to find out we‚Äôre still in the past
Sorry Jeremy but you are a month late to the party üòÅ
Ok now go watch DRACULA lol
‚ÄúCiri, like the apple Ai‚Äù<br>U got me lmao
The song is amazing toss a coin to your witcher
Nice to see a good review from someone who was not familiar with the games and books.
I hated the first episode, starter to love it the last couple, they hated the last episode <br><br>meh lol
Well dude. Game of thrones is COMPLETELY different to witcher. The only similarity is the setting. and even that is wildly different.
Don&#39;t worry Jeremy I only played the Witcher 3 but started listening to the audio books. Can&#39;t wait for season 2. Oh yea and of course more Awesometacular vids from you too.
C&#39;mon Jeremy, it&#39;s time to &quot;invest&quot; 200 plus hours of your life into the Witcher 3.
Haven&#39;t played them huh...? Like many others here, Im&#39;ma tell you to play it. Take your time and dedicate a few hours a day to soak in the beauty that is the game. Its one of those games you have to play before you die.
DC really fucked up by letting Henry go. Thank God he got a great gig like the witcher
Seriously. No Wild Hunt?
Play the fucking game jeremy. Just start with witcher 3
Funny to see someone that likes yen... each their own
Jeremy Jahns: &quot;I haven&#39;t played the witcher games.&quot;<br><br>Me: <b>cocks shotgun</b><br><br><br><br><br>I am joking don&#39;t take me serious I love you Jeremy no homo.
season 2 bouta b brazy
Amazing... Are you trying to do again the same thing you did to your friend with the GOT books, and spoil a massively important thing Jeremy?
Man you gonna play the game it&#39;s simply prefect in every way possible
A leather jacket doesn‚Äôt stop bullets, right guys?
Witcher was fantastic  and I love it. Can&#39;t wait for season 2üî•üî•. And yeah my fav character also Yennifer üî•
That song &#39;toss a coin&#39; drives me nuts , fucking hate it. good show though
I made it to episode 5 before I gave up. Show was too confusing.
Witcher 3 is overrated, don&#39;t listen to them Jeremy
It was pretty good imo but it could be wayyyyy better. Geralt and Dandelion are amazing, but Ciri and Yennefer could be better. Fringilla, Cahir and Nilfgaard overall are kinda terrible. As was Villentretenmerth the dragon.<br><br>I&#39;m a huge Witcher fan but I agree The Mandalorian is much better.
Hmm
You ok bro? Figured I&#39;d ask..
It was okay the story was weak.
This was awful. So slow and the acting was wooden
enought for me.. lests wat iyt again XD
I like the Witchers production but in honesty the story is straight up Autistic. 6/10
A decent review. Also, the Witcher 3 is insanely cheap to buy nowadays (even on the Switch is on sale), what are YOU waiting for, JEREMY?!?
Give this man some Orens
srsly, i reckon ull luv the witcher 3
Why have you not played The Witcher, Jeremy? I certainly thought that you&#39;d be a Witcher fan considering your love for videogames.
Do u have a review for the magicians? ... it‚Äôs on Netflix
The whole first season was a prologue to the actual story of the series. Still, it was a good prologue.
I thought you reviewed this
You haven‚Äôt reviewed red dead 2 either
Play the third one
Read the books, they are awesome.<br>Played the games they are awesome (Witcher 3 is top 3 of the decade easily).<br>Watched the show, it was pretty awesome too. <br>Witcher is awesome.
Don&#39;t worry, Ciri will get better as a character in future seasons
Loved the games, books and show. Can&#39;t wait to see more.
Check out the review that Semz done ages ago. Another super geek and great vibes
Unlimited power and  beauty everlasting<br>Can‚Äôt have babies
The games are effectively a sequel to the books. The first two books are a collection of short stories that span many years and jump around. This series adapts various stories from those first two books and is a mostly faithful adaptation though there are a few major changes. All in all I loved the series and look forward to more. It sounds like they plan to adapt all of the books so future seasons shouldn&#39;t have the same time shenanigans. <br><br>On a side note: go read the damn books and play the freakin games! They&#39;re both really good!
D&#39;aww Jeremy didn&#39;t even talk about Jaskier.
Here&#39;s a drinking game:<br>Drink every time someone in the show says &quot;destiny&quot; while you watch it
You had 6 years to review the game 6 full years come on ü§ê
I didn&#39;t like the First Episode. But I will keep watching if Jeremy suggests it. I feel like we have similar tastes.
Hmmm.. must play the game... hmm...
<b>**Possible book SPOILERS**</b><br><br>Jeremy: &quot;Leather doesn&#39;t protect from pitchfork&quot; <br><br>Geralt: -.-
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=6m25s"">6:25</a> what about books?
First scene opens with terrible CGI.<br>First episode didn&#39;t exactly captivate, apart from one gruesome fight.<br>Current show score: 4.5/10<br><br>Second episode gets a bit more interesting, but still generally underwhelming. <br>Updated show score: 6/10<br><br>It took me about 3 or so episodes to really get into this show, but by the end of the season, I&#39;d give it a solid 7.5/10 overall... Some episodes are a bit dull, but the season works well as a cohesive whole.
Witcher games are not fun,very repetitive, terrible combat system and overall over rated.
Like a lot of people I got introduced to the IP through the games so both Yen and Triss just looked off to me. The casting just wasn&#39;t what I had in mind and that&#39;s probably what caused the uproar on twitter. The actress who played Yen however is incredibly talented so I&#39;m totally willing to ignore it. Triss on the other hand just wasn&#39;t very well acted imo. They definitely should&#39;ve given the role of Triss to the women who played Renfri instead.
Toss a coin to your witcher <br>A friend of humanity
Hey Jeremy, try watching peaky blinders hahaha
I couldn&#39;t watch past episode two, maybe I should carry on after seeing this review
Finally ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed your time. I‚Äôm severely excited for season 2!
When the beat hits ..<br>Ungch ungch ungchch
Dude 1 year laterüôÑ
The games are a sequel of the books some say they&#39;re canon some say they&#39;re not
.
The show was pretty bad to be honest the pacing was the worst part and weird changes to some character for no reason
Mr. Robot! Do Mr. Robot!
Jeremy&#39;s complaints: The nonlinear narrative takes a while to get used to. But I did end up enjoying this season.<br>The Critical Drinker&#39;s complaints: The nonlinear narrative takes a while to get used to. Also, how did black people get there? Political correctness, I assume.
The line, &quot;Put your pitchfork down,&quot;  is funny for both the video and a pun for the game. Anyone who has played the games will get the joke.
Well done, that EDM party joke was funny...now do you plan to review Titans? Just binged season two...
Now Dracula there is only 3 eps
Knda crazy cause Ciri is like the most important character in the Witcher universe. The whole story is really about her. I agree that the time jumps were a little confusing to those who do not know a great deal about the the Witcher series in general. I wonder how many people actually realize that Yennefer of Vengerberg is in fact hundreds of years old.
My advice is just play ‚ÄúWitcher 3‚Äù. I stumbled onto the game at Bestbuy for $25. Bought it and played it. Now I love it. It‚Äôs my top 3 Game of all times. The other ones are ‚ÄúRed Dead 2‚Äù and ‚ÄúMass Effect‚Äù. <br>Cheers üçª
Jeremy is lowkey gay for Henry.
Hmm. The Witcher show is like a pie with all the right filling.
Jeremy you should atleast play the 3rd game. You do not need the previous 2 games to get into it too. Maybe Witcher 2 but only half of it is relevant to the shit show that goes down in Witcher 3
Jeremy: &quot;I don‚Äôt know if leather protects from pitchforks&quot;<br>Palpatine: Ironic
I enjoyed The Witcher. Great review.
I also find it funny that Jeremy makes a pitchfork reference without knowing how applicable it is for the witcher lol
Games are sequels to the books, so we can say the series is a prequel to the games.
<b>Ngl This Series was Pretty Weak</b> The Next Series should be more promising - but as of now - it‚Äôs REALLY nothing special
The bitching about Yennifer makes absolutely no sense. It is like those folks watched a different show.
Although my mouth hangs agape at your admission,  methinks perhaps twas better this way. Your review was without bias. Well, done. Now, go back and play those games...now...or at least after you complete Death Stranding. I agree with you on both points, the passage of time was to say the least difficult to follow and the jumping back and forth between characters the same. I have to guess that more than a couple of viewers who didn&#39;t know the story gave up early. The actress who portrays Yennefer is spot on. Except, why give her those violet eyes, then obliterate them with that painfully old fashioned green eye shadow? Henry as Geralt is a dream come true. He&#39;s not much of an actor,  but my oh my how he fills out those Superman tights and the Witcher&#39;s armor (sigh). Jeremy, you have your finger on the pulse of popular culture. I have a question for you. Why are current movies, tv shows, series filled with &quot;fuck.&quot; Seriously, it&#39;s dropped into places it doesn&#39;t belong. For example, in the current season of The Expanse. What do you think?
why does anybody like this series?<br>the dialogue is not that great<br>i cant really stand yennefer talking<br>the time jumps are hateful<br>the acting is not so great<br>there is not much to it really<br>i didn&#39;t like it
Watch Witcher 3 game videos on here and listen to Geralt&#39;s voice, then Henry Cavill&#39;s voice as Geralt and you will be impressed.
Didn&#39;t play the games until... today lol, But the story was good the acting was terrific.  The time thing yeah could have been handled better in the dialog so we didn&#39;t have to wait until the last three episodes to figure that out.  Love your take
I played the Witcher 3 but never read the books. I will watch the series. Maybe some day I will read the books. This is a very strange order to do things in.
The games are far superior, give them a shot Jeremy! :)
Jeremy: &quot;I haven&#39;t played The Witcher games&quot;<br><br>WELL STREAM YOURSELF PLAYING THEM DAMMIT. WE WANNA SEE
The witch is a good time no alcohol required.
No leather jacket will save u üòÇ
<b>Toss a coin to your reviewer</b>
Man, I did not like the show. I had to give up halfway through because I just found it boring. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Here‚Äôs what the general idea of Witch with that passage of time going on in the series. <br><br>If they didn‚Äôt do any of that, Ciri wouldn‚Äôt be introduced let alone mentioned till the end of Season 2 or beginning of Season 3. It‚Äôs weird I know but still Netflix had to try and get the big three characters and that‚Äôs how.
Bought witcher 1-3 on steam for about 15 dollars never played them before. Soon done with the first game, it is really great!
I just want to hear Cavill say &quot;Winds howling,&quot; or &quot;How do you like that silver?&quot;<br><br>Witcher 3 is my favorite game and 2nd game I&#39;ve rated 10/10. Another being God of War 4
The only reason the voice is weird is because you haven‚Äôt played the games, not knocking you tho homie just saying
You haven&#39;t played what?
Finally Jeremy tossed his coin to this gem.
How Dare You!! Good Sir!!  Cirilla is A Goddess!!!  And Go and play The Witcher 3 for God‚Äôs sakes
I played The WItcher 3 for few hours only. I quit after the quest for frying pan. I didn&#39;t even finish the quest. The side quests looked too many, they kinda kill the mood to finish the game.
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooo!!!! you definitely should play it :(
Never played the games or read the books.  Really liked the series and am ready for the next season.  The only thing it needs is some more budget for the cgi.
You should play the Witcher 3 Jeremy...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> before you get hurt
Not playing Witcher 3 should be illegal.
The Witcher began as a series of short stories, which were collected in an anthology before the main series was published.  I&#39;m on book 3 of the main story, and I&#39;d say the TV series has done as good a job as they reasonably can of portraying the storyline.  I agree that it has the unfortunate side effect of making the story seem a little disjointed.
&quot;It&#39;s like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling&quot; - Geralt of Rivia
How damm ironic that Jeremy wonders if leather will stop pitchforks when doing a review of the Witcher. 10/10
Also maybe The Witcher wont blow it like GOT did...(fingers x&#39;d)
Yeah I lost too many brain cells trying to understand the timeline üòîü§ß
U haven&#39;t played the games? Jeremy this is simply unforgivable and outrageous. I recommend u play the game this very instant because i assure u will never forget the wonderful experience it&#39;s better than any star wars games or those second class star wars remakes by Disney put together.
Playing the games helped a lot because they don&#39;t take the time to explain much in this series (the signs aka spells Geralt casts for example). The thing that caught me off guard was the time jumps. <br><br>I didn&#39;t realise for a few episodes that the characters were in different times and I only realised because of a non spoiler review... I wonder how long I would have gone before I realised, it probably would have been around episode 6.
<b>I really dislike Ciri&#39;s eye lenses.</b>
The time jumping is done to make you watch it again to really enjoy it. They&#39;re so clever.
it sucks
Fuck GOT ‚Äúfixes‚Äù go watch Attack on Titan Jeremy ..
hey jeremy, why did you adapt the Josuke hairstyle?
PLAY THE WITCHER ALREADY !!
You are doing yourself a disservice if you haven&#39;t played the witcher 3
Jeremy, it&#39;s actually not &quot;just&quot; the princess or Ciri. It&#39;s Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, Queen of Cintra, Princess of Brugge and Duchess of Sodden, Heiress to Inis Ard Skellig and Inis An Skellig and Suzerain of Attre and Abb Yarra. Ciri to friends.
It&#39;s okay Jeremy, I also haven&#39;t played the Witcher games.
Would a Steel pitchfork work on Jeremy, or would I need a silver one?
Jeremy, please review ‚ÄúYou‚Äù season 1 and 2!
Review Messiah too
Jeremy would you like to buy a fridge? It&#39;s NOT a washing machine .. I&#39;m in the UK so if you could collect that would be smashing Xx
I was expecting Jeremy to reference ‚ÄúToss a Coin‚Äù
If you haven&#39;t played the Witcher games, that&#39;s fine, but now you have all the more reason to do it :)<br>Fair warning, though, the first game DID NOT age well in terms of graphics, but still fantastic to play. Witcher 2 was also great, and Witcher 3...oh my god.
Toss a like to your Jeremy.
The witcher is shit..unless you&#39;re a die hard fan of the witcher
That&#39;s the way I felt the show got better for me as it went on.  The time jump list me tho
WTF!????????!!!!???!?!!?!!?
I enjoyed the show but:<br>not playing the games is actually good for the show because you won&#39;t see how bad the visuals (nilfgaard, wtf?!) or the (triss!) casts are in comparison to the games<br><br>...<br><br>that said you should totally play them!
I said it before, I will say it again<br>I like Jeremy&#39;s hand movements.
&quot;Insert hateful comment&quot; -&gt; Goes blind -&gt; Worth it
This show is a shit show. Hopefully it will be better next season without all the mess
Haven&#39;t played the games or read the books and the multiple timelines in the show really screwed with my ability to properly enjoy as I didn&#39;t actaully realise what was happening till around ep5. Even then I&#39;m pretty mixed on the show. I enjoyed the themes and the characters of Geralt and Yennifer but the overarching story and jumping around timelines without realising that was happening didnt work that well for me. I&#39;ll likely still give season 2 a go but I really hope they tighten up their storytelling. Individual episodes worked fine in a self contained state but as an overarching story it was a mess.
The neverending truth to the witcher games is that no matter what you do,(mostly) your always the asshole, this shoe embodies that pretty damn well
Should they do bloody baron? That  was where the Witcher 3 got me hooked
My 1rst experience with the Witcher story was in the game which are considered sequels to the books. So its like im following a prequel story with the show that are answering some questions and theories i had about the characters pasts and i&#39;m recognizing alot of callbacks to the books that the games had, i love it
Same here...never read the books or played the game, but i definitely enjoyed this!
I went into watching The Witcher blind. I&#39;ve never read the books. I&#39;ve never played the games. Nada. However my husband is a huge Witcher fan. It&#39;s the only series he&#39;s ever read. So he&#39;s like &#39;you have to watch it! It&#39;s so good.&#39; I gave it a try..... most of the episodes were really dull (except fight scenes), and some were really good. I had a problem also with the timeline jumping stuff. I hope season 2 is better than this one. Yennifer is also my favorite.
<b>Hmmm and Fuck</b> <br><br><br>Best dialogue ever said by a badass
You need to play the game
üëç
Dude... Play the game. You probably won&#39;t make any videos for like 3 months because you wanna finish it with all the quest... And when you think you&#39;re done you find yourself finding a frying pan for an old lady... But you know play it...
The show is just ok. It‚Äôs nothing special and no where close to GOT season 1. the CGI is awful. Henry tires to much to sound like Geralts Voice actor from the game and it‚Äôs cringe worthy. Important stuff from the books was cut out and replaced with things that have no importance to the story.
&quot; I will say it could have done passage of time better, sometimes a lot of time passes...&quot;  - throwaway line :&quot;! haven&#39;t seen you in this many years, ok it&#39;s been that long..&quot; LOL! Well what can we say, It&#39;s a mega universe but they&#39;re not <b>telling</b> - &quot;I don&#39;t think those 2 locations are near each other...are they?&quot; Really magical...but they&#39;re not telling! Enjoyed your review!
Review ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù season 1 and 2 please
The entire thing is stolen from Elric of Melnibone the white wolf.
I&#39;m gonna be honest, i did not like this show. Short story, my friend and I thought the plot was confusing and not smooth. Timeline was werid, and didnt take their time to have a consistent storyline. Don&#39;t get me wrong, cavill and whoever plays yennefer were great, but the production design and costume was a little bad. Also kinda poor way to introduce geralt, i wouldve loved to have seen that story of his first monster that he killed and that the girl who he saved from the monster was afraid of him
Witcher 3 is my favourite video game of all time, once you played it all other RPGs just won&#39;t feel the same especially the side quests.
I bought Witcher 3 literally seconds after finishing the show xD
I was kinda excited to watch it but the acting was so cringey I couldn&#39;t finish the first episode.
The Pitchfork joke was double funny, because Geralt almost died because of a peasant with a pitchfork XD
Definitely enjoyed the show. Though it feels a bit like the first season is a setup for what&#39;s to come, which i can understand as well. Exited to see the upcoming seasons!
Jeremy! Play the Witcher Wild Hunt! You don&#39;t even need to review it just do it for yourself man, you&#39;re missing out!
review witcher 3 Jeremy
&quot; Evil is Evil ... Lesser greater... Its all the same... But now, if i have to choose between one evil and another, then i prefer not to choose at all. &quot;<br>My favorite line the first episode. Also a line that is played in the Witcher 3 game... Which is probably why i like it so much üòÉ
Day 1 petition for jeremy to review parasite
Very disappointed jeremy didn&#39;t sing &quot;Toss a Coin to your Witcher&quot; üò¢
Watched the first episode,  wasn&#39;t really feeling it.  Going to give it another try thank you for the review.
The Witcher is okay, it&#39;s entertaining but intentionally convoluted since it&#39;s non-linear. The humor landed for me in fact I laughed out loud in Episodes 2 and 4.
Throw a sub to your YouTuber
I told my friend that Yenefer is the most interested character.
I was actually hoping/expecting Jeremy to sing &#39;the song&#39; for his intro hahahahaha!!!

Season 2 not coming out until 2021...
Jeremy: siri<br>Me: OK so he is asking siri to Google it...Cool cool.
Nice review as always, keep up the good work! Regarding the game (Witcher 3, obviously), I suggest you play it. The TV show is not bad and I personally enjoyed it, however it is definitely no masterpiece (the overall pacing and the confusing time-jumps are only two examples of uneven quality). The game, on the other hand, is the true masterpiece imho.
Judging by the games the show must be 50% nudity. My assumption
honestly, I thought <i>The Witcher</i> was a mesa and I didn‚Äôt know what the f*kk was going on most of the time...
I cant believe you haven&#39;t played the Witcher games...COME on jerenaybfi aufgaue dnaif qbfualdn jhkjhkhj hjhjkhj
Your read of Yennefer of Vengenberg is spot on. It was mostly original content for the series, and it&#39;s very effective.
You should really play the games and read the books. I think you might enjoy them.
Could just watch you with no sound and still be entertained
unexepcted
They need better world building ie show us the map/kingdom
I watched the first half of the season baked af and didn&#39;t even notice it was telling 2 timelines until I watch the other half the next day lol rip
Loved the games and this show, never read the book series, but am open to it. Btw the games were meant to be the sequels to the events in the books, while the show is an adaptation of the books itself which i find intriguing
Now we know subject of discussion between AJ and Jeremy next time they will meet :)))
The show is mediocre at best, bad at worst. People are eating it up though.<br><br>The best thing about the show is the absolutely fantastic song &quot;Toss a coin to your witcher&quot;.
I had no idea what was going on in this show
Never too late to start a Witcher 3 playthrough Jeremy!*<br><br><b>One of us, one of us, gooble gable one of us!</b><br><br>*or indeed start another one after you&#39;ve played it twice already
It‚Äôs ok, Jeremy. Most of us haven‚Äôt played any of the Witcher games sans Wild Hunt
Agreed about Yennifer being the best, Geralt is great, and Ciri was the weakest component. I also loved that Netflix already greenlit a season 2. Queen Calanthe should have aged, she looks the same during the wedding scene and then 17 years later when Ciri is a teenager, I honestly couldnt tell that Calanthe was her grandmother because they didn&#39;t age her at all.
Jeremy: <br>&quot;I haven&#39;t played the Witcher games&quot;.<br><br>Everybody: <br>&quot;hmm&quot;
Review attack on titan. A worthy successor to GOT
Only normies are expecting game of thrones. Why are you an echo chamber for normies?
just go play them...right meow
I can imagine that a character like yennifer would be a dream to play for a talented actor.
Can&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t talk about toss a coin to your witcher lol such a great song
Btw Jeremy apparently when sorceress go through their change they basically stop aging.  And Witchers age slowly I think.
My biggest gripe with the show is that the dialogue can be a bit TOO fantasy-ish? In the games, the dialogue is more grounded while also fitting the era. <br><br>Not saying the show should copy the games‚Äô style but it should go somewhere near that route with the dialogue.
I encourage you to read the books, and play the games. This stuff is great.
Fuck.
Hmm
I&#39;m watching it a 2nd time now. I gotta say the 2nd and 3rd episode are the peak of what I want from the show. The actors are great, but the writing can be exposition city. Plus Yennefer going from wanting ALL POWER to world weary and mournful of her sacrifice just rang hollow when it happened between episodes because of a time jump. I really hope they iron out the show, simplify, and just let the characters (especially the Witcher) do things. I don&#39;t need an overriding plot, back stories, pointlessly drawn out mystery to keep me interested.
Watch the show knowing nothing about it.. liked it so much im playing the witcher 3 right now on ps4 and its soo good lol
Yeah, my GF and I both had issues were the time jumps. I have the books and the games and it took me a while to get the time jumps. My gf and I both agreed, putting the date at the start of scenes would help a lot .
I&#39;ve been waiting for you to review this. I binged it all in one day
gonna check out &#39;his dark materials&#39;?
The Witcher games are so overrated üòÇ
Witcher good.
When that black guy smashed Yennefer I was... I don‚Äôt want to say disgusted? But it was intriguing.
I mean the only flaws of this show so t be an issue in the next season, ciri‚Äôs story gets much better and the reason the time was jumpy was because the first two books were short stories and the had to introduce everyone, and the rest of the books are linear
PLAY THE WITCHER : WILD HUNT, JEREMY!!!!
70+ years pass in the show.
I finally beat Witcher 3 lastnight... PLAY THE GAME JEREMY!
I have tried, I have tried! I bought the Witcher 3 on ps4 nearly 2 years ago, I have tried immersing myself into the game at least a half dozen times and I just have not been able to. I WANT to like the game.<br><br>But the show was pretty good. I enjoyed it.
You should really play the whole series if you can.<br><br>But man Witcher 1 sucks.<br>Jump straight to 3, with all DLC, and have a really great 200+ hours
The 18 dislikes are from the people that didn&#39;t like that you haven&#39;t yet played Witcher 3 bro
This show is hot mess, but it&#39;s still very entertaining.
What point does it hook you at? I had to give up in the third episode because the trees were less wooden than the acting. Loved the queen at the beginning though. <br><br>Maybe Jeremy couldn&#39;t get past the voice at first was because it was so hard to get interested.
I loved the season, I cannot wait for more! I have not played the games or read the books tho. I have heard that makes the show not as enjoyable.
The Witcher TV series goes deep into The Witcher lore and world as much as  Tall Girl explores the struggle of teenagers.
Is Jeremy growing Wolverine hair? If so I am here for it!
I haven‚Äôt played it either but after watching the series, I plan to play it lol
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=01m17s"">01:17</a> <br>Jeremy: &quot; &#39;cause we all know of Yennifer&quot;<br>üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br>Ain&#39;t that the truth?

but-bu-but he didn&#39;t talk about Jaskier! <br><br><br><br><br>TOOOSSSSSSSS A COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIN TO YOUR WITCHERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!
Why don&#39;t you just get that background in real life?
Without reading the books, took me like 4 episodes to figure out that there were two timelines separated by decades. Personally, the 2nd viewing was much more enjoyable
Best qoute in the whole series.<br><br>&quot;hmm.....fuck!&quot;<br><br>- Geralt
Yeah I know the voice is wierd to an outsider. Id say just watch a gameplay clip of Witcher 3 and you&#39;ll see why.
Ain‚Äôt nobody got time for Witcher 3 game lol
No one going to talk about the casting for Triss or Fringilla? Ok
Have been waiting for this for a while! <br>Gotta love a bit of Jeremy.
Best character was actually Jaskier :D
Play the fucking game Jeremy, you‚Äôre missing out
Loved it
Absolutely loved the shows and the Witcher video game trilogy is my favorite of all time! Happy late new year JJ love your movies and shows reviews üòÅ
What you are describing is really the same effect of reading &#39;The Last Wish,&#39; the short story collection that most of Season 1 was based on - &#39;What the hell is going on? OH CRAP! I&#39;ll figure out what&#39;s going on later, GERALT just *insert action here.*&#39;
<b>uses siri on an android</b>
Jeremy: put the keyboard down stop with the hateful comments<br>Me, on an iPhone: <b>You haven‚Äôt... played the Witcher Games??</b>
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather protects from pitchforks&quot; <br>Probably Geralt has some point of view on that.
Thank you sir thank you very much for uploading this.... We need critics like you spread the word of the people
I also NEVER played the witcher games as well so I judge this series as it is and I do love the world of the Witcher. I can&#39;t wait for season 2.
Stop comparing it to Game of Thrones dammit!!!!!! üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Hmm
Play The Witcher 3, you will not regret it. And the GOTY edition is easy to find for cheap, the expansions add dozens of hours of great content.
I can&#39;t wait for season 2
<b>Jeremy says he hasn‚Äôt play the games</b><br>Geralt-‚ÄúhMMMMM FUCK‚Äù
Seriously go play the game man atleast witcher 3. Anyone who has played Witcher 3 will know that Ciri is the heart of the party in that game.
Is it spoiler review?<br>i watched the 1st episode only!
Jeremy review The Witcher pls
No Jeremy Jahns intro <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>FUCK
I&#39;m on the same boat. I own Witcher III, even went so far as to download it when I finished watching this. Combat system is one of those &#39; you are going to play this for 3 months - nothing else&#39; systems and I agree. This was Yen. Geralt was supporting cast for Yen. I watched others play this so I knew who Yen, Geralt, Ciri and Tris were. I did like the show. I just felt the ending was too abrupt. It&#39;s like they filmed until the bank was dry and there was no planning involved. They got up one day and balance said 0 so they stopped filming and launched the show. It was the biggest nuisance factor for me.
the Witcher 3 is my favourite game of all time. Please if you get a chance, give it a play through.
Please play The Witcher 3 Jeremy. Do it for the human race! üòÇ
&quot;I dont know if leather protects me from pitchforks&quot;<br><br>Holy shit! the foreshadowing in this one!!!
As I&#39;m currently watching halfway through the series, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m feeling the same way how Jeremy felt when he watched the series.
I couldn&#39;t get into it
Jeremy for God sake play witcher games
does it have the sex? i cant wach if it had the sex
Would you do Yen?<br><br>Like if yes comment why if no
You have to play and review Witcher 3 wild hunt. You hate micro transactions and loot box bullshit right? Well this game has none of it. It‚Äôs from CD projekt red. Play and review!
Play the effing game!!!
It‚Äôs ok that you haven‚Äôt played the games really only one of them is good and they all take place ten years after the shows story
Love the games <br>Love the show <br>Love the books <br>Witcher 3 is the best Witcher media atm
Just FYI, if you ever decide to play the games: the action takes place after the books, so they might spoil the future seasons of the show for you.
Aww I wanted him to talk about the best character: Jaskier!
I just can&#39;t get on board with who they cast as Yennefer..
Please I&#39;m begging just watch watchmen series  please
I&#39;ve seen two episodes so far and I&#39;m not very impressed. Yennefer seems especially miscast. Maybe I just have some aversion towards ultra-serious, dark fantasy after how terrible the last season of GoT was.
I always find it weird when someone zip up they leather jacket
Witcher 3 review please
Exactly my thoughts!üí™
Jeremy needs to play Red Dead Redemption 2 best story ever.
Hmm
As a pretty hardcore witcher fan, I reallly liked henry as geralt but the season as a whole was meh at best.
It&#39;s ok, Jeremy. The Witcher games are overrated anyway.
FINALLLY
The Witcher video games actually act as a sequel to the books and novels. The series (from my understanding) just tells stories from the books and novels with no connection to the games.
CGI was really bad at times, to much time gaps between some episodes, some casting choices are way off, storylines where told way to fast. The show has flaws, and it is not very close to the books, but it is still overall good. Cavill kills it and carrys the show really well. It is not a top tier class show like game of thrones, it never will be, but it is allright for what it is, and the Fans are overall liking it. So good job netlfix, no alcohol required.
The books are great and not a hard read
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if leather protects from pitchforks‚Äù oh, Jeremy, such a poor choice of words<br><br>Major spoilers in the replys btw
Thank you Jeremy for this review üôè you&#39;re the best
I think this series should be more compare to Hercules, Xena, and even Spartacus(Starz tv show) than Game of Thrones(Witcher only took the mature theme and look of it but not anything else). Witcher is more on the entertaining side.
I never played the games or even read the books, it took me some time to get used to the timeline and to understand EXACTLY what was going on but overall it was such an amazing show and I cant wait for season 2
Lol i haven&#39;t played the games either. I watched what little my friends played of the first 2 and 3 is catching dust on my dresser cause im too lazy to start it üòÇ
Review DARK netflix
Play the Witcher 3 Jeremy, It&#39;ll also take a few hours to click, but it&#39;s worth it... like really worth it. By a few hours I mean at least 8 - 10 hours
episode 1 i wasnt sure <br>by episode 4 i couldnt wait for more
Dude..okay great vid but what is going on with your hairüòÇüòÇ
Review Witcher 3 JBear. You know you want to.
Wait where is the rating??
The time was a bit confusing
Choose your dialogues:<br>(X) Hmmm<br>(Y) Fuck!
I hated bard
The aim of the first season was to attract &quot;non-witcher&quot; audience, not to please game/book nerds, and it definitely succeded judging by Jeremy`s opinion. I can`t wait for another seasons
How has this man not played a Witcher game!?!? ever!?!?
Jeremy: &quot;I haven&#39;t played The Witcher games&quot;<br><br>...<br><br><b>Well how long&#39;re you gonna make me wait?</b>
In case any of you still crave a Game of Thrones fix, Vikings is also a good option
I guess iam the only one who found witcher boring except the start and the end
Whaaaaaaat?!!! U havnt played the witcher 3üòµüò∂
first time I stop watching one of your videos¬† HOW CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF A GAMER and not have played Witcher 3 ?eventually I finished the video lol
You gotta agree Henry Cavill is now known as the role he plays in the Witcher than Clark Kent or Superman
First Witcher game takes place 5 years after the last Witcher book.
Jeremy you better play it or prepare for the storm.<br><br>P. S: Please hear the game ST
The show is quite a lot of better if you know about the lore and the characters. From what I have understood the first season is pretty accurate retelling of one of the books.
I‚Äôm kinda bothered by some casting choices and some stuff about some stuff in fantasy settings but I‚Äôm not gonna say it because i think YouTube autoblocks that stuff because free speech and stuff.
I don&#39;t get why a lot of critics didn&#39;t like the first episode... I was hella hooked and it&#39;s one of my favorite episodes honestly.
I wish they showed ciri killing those ppl in farm tht would hav made her more memorable
I guess now you have to go play Witcher 3 XD
Bro. You gotta play Witcher 3. One of the <b>GREATEST</b> games of all time, hands down.

Death stranding review?!
I&#39;m with you, man. Never played The Witcher games. Not interested. Just not my thang.
Toss a like to your youtuber, oh valley of content!
Why is everything different a controversy?
Toss a coin too your Jeremy! Friend of humanity!
JEREMY!!! JOKER got ELEVEN Oscar nominations!!!
I haven‚Äôt even seen the show and I already have a new favorite quote, ‚Äú... Fuck‚Äù
Jeremy : I haven‚Äôt played the witcher 3<br>Me : Hmmm....Fuck
It wasn&#39;t bad, entertaining at least. I just need to stop mentally comparing it to Game of ThronesüòÇ
Play the Witcher 3 at least, Jeremy. I beg of you.
His voice is like that cause that&#39;s how it is in the games and how it&#39;s alluded to in the books..
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one that actually doesn‚Äôt like the show, I really wanted to like it but there a multiple factors in this show that I can‚Äôt ignore. For example the dialogue, costume designs, make up, special effects and at times the acting. I felt like the story was fine but not mind blowing or anything. Anyone else feel the same? <br><br><br>Also let me remind y‚Äôall that an opinion is just an opinion before all the Witcher fanboys come after me
Review witcher 3
Awesome
Never played the games, but after watching the show ordered the books
Wow!! Too early
It was... alright-tacular.
As someone who read the books i can tell you That letter does not in fact block pitchforks.
how could you even watch this show without playing at least witcher 3
Toss a coin to your Witcher....
A reviewer is never late.<br>Everyone else is simply early.
All right we got Witcher!! Now waiting for Watchmen!!!!!!!
Would you kindly do a bioshock infinite spoiler review
Me too  i haven&#39;t played the witcher games
The correct word for things like the &quot;Jennifer Controversy&quot; is Non-troversy.<br><br>If the only people complaining about something are on Twitter, nobody actually cares enough about the thing to do something. Or at least not enough to anonymously whine about it online.

Finally!
Toss a like to your Jeremy.
Play the witcher 3! I never played 1 or 2 and I fully understood 3 and it‚Äôs my favorite game of all time. <br><br>You won‚Äôt regret it.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m59s"">0:59</a> even i started playing witcher 3 after watching the series...
I don&#39;t blame you for not playing the witcher. It&#39;s a big investment cause once you start playing you get lost in the world.
So late<br>I havent played witcher too<br>R u tat person
Is a slow start for sure due to the fact it&#39;s based of the first two books (which are collection of short stories), once it got going it really sunk in.<br><br>Good news is at least with season 2 it will have a more linear storyline and won&#39;t have the muddled 3 timelines
Hmm..
Needed a Game of Thrones fix since before Game of Thrones endedüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº<br>Honestly though, loved The Witcher
You haven&#39;t played any of the games? I&#39;m coming for you son!
Toss a coin to Jeremy for finally reviewing this!
I haven&#39;t read the books, but I&#39;ve played the witcher 3: wild hunt. I thought the series was great, loved the reveal (and on a rewatch the obvious hints) about the time lines. However, even with that previous exposure I still needed to ask a friend a lot of background questions (mostly more about characters than lore). I can see how this would be confusing or hard to get into for others without that knowledge.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> this is the exact problem I had with Ciri in the books. The fun stops when it focuses on her and you&#39;re just wondering. &quot;Man I wonder what Geralt is doing right now&quot;
You know the pitchforks are coming and yet you still refuse to play the game?!?!
jeremy uploads season review of witcher<br><br><br>Me: Hmmmmmm...
well, at least he&#39;s honest...but let me be honest....You need to play the witcher 3, FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD!!!! PLAY IT!!
the review I have been waiting for finally
The Witcher was phenomenal, I personally loved Cavill‚Äôs performance as Geralt
I loved The Witcher so much that now I&#39;m afraid if I read the books it&#39;s gonna be ruined for me forever, even more than GOT üòÖ
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE PLAYED THE WITCHER GAMES! YOU MUST BE INSANE! Jeremy please look into your priorities and get them in order.<br><br><br><br>- From someone who has never played the Witcher games. Or read the books. Or fully understood the TV show.
Toss a coin to Jeremy~
As good as Raiden in Mortal Kombat with Christopher Lambert...<br>It felt like watching Xena the TV show
Man, You are the best.
Hey Jeremy...Big fan....Can you review Dracula 2020?
Still waiting on an umbrella academy review!!!
It‚Äôs confusing if you don‚Äôt know the books or the game.
Review JoJo Rabbit!
Do you part! Toss a coin to your witcher.
The irony of your pitchfork comment is Geralt dies in the books by being stabbed by a pitchfork. üòÇ
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m47s"">0:47</a>  i feel you jeremy ü§£ü§£ü§£
I honestly haven‚Äôt played the Witcher games either
Last time I was this early we all hoped Jeremy will do the top 10 movies of the decade... Reality is often  disappointing
Im comment number 89
I like that Henry fought for the role because his understanding and passion for the character shines through. It still has its flaws but I feel like they are on the right track
Honestly though do play the witcher 3. Even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll like that sort of thing, i reckon you will. I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of fantasy or RPGs beforehand, and now the witcher 3 is my favourite game of all time
I literally haven&#39;t watched it, was waiting for this review. Yes
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O36lgfQ7mDk&amp;t=0m47s"">0:47</a> Ok, so is no one creeped out by the fact Jeremy predicted something major right there? I mean, the phrasing is way too convenient.
Go play it man. Go
Play the gameüôä
IF you weren&#39;t awesometacular I would DEFINITELY be bringing out the pitchfork!üòÖ
Play and review The Witcher 3! It&#39;s a masterpiece!

THE GAMES ARE 10x better than this trash series. The writing and dialogue and storytelling are far better in the game. Do yourself a favor and play witcher 3. Yenn got way too much screen time and the feminism and modern day politics are bullshit.
Jeremy I need answers WILL YOU EVER WATCH &quot;YOU&quot;
FINALLY
The Witcher proves what Henry Cavill can do with a good script.i love him as Superman but WB did our boy wrong
Hey if you like RPG‚Äôs you will love The Witcher 3
Play the Witcher 3. That is all.
I haven‚Äôt played the games or read the books but the show was still damned good.
Jeremy needs to play the Witcher games. Witcher 3 is probably my favorite game of all time.
Gonna review ‚Äúmessiah‚Äù? Would be interested to see what you think.
Check out The Expanse already!
Please watch Little Women!
Play the game jeremyüòÇ
Yey! Tyty
You should at least play 3. It basically tells you everything you need to know about the world and it isn&#39;t required to play Witcher 1 and 2

CcpmD5J8xOk,"Hi guys I&#39;d just like to leave this comment here asking everyone to watch the whole video before judging my opinion. I feel as if I was quite respectful to those of you that might disagree with me because as I said in the video I didn&#39;t and will never make a video with the intention of upsetting someone or with the intention of telling them I&#39;m right and they&#39;re wrong. Everyone has different opinion&#39;s on things and I think it&#39;s just better if we all just respect that we each have different opinions and move on. You&#39;re all great regardless of your view on a tv show and I hope you all have a great Christmas!
As someone who only played witcher 3, i like season 1, but the other seasons..? What the hell were the writers thinking or not thinking. It seems like they were just pushing progressive politics and using name recognition for a cash grab
If I don‚Äôt associate the show with the games or the books then it‚Äôs a good show. üòÇ
I enjoyed season 1 then season 2 started swaying from the path not that it was all canon anywa, but season 2 SUCKED. Then we have blood origins. Now it&#39;s a cluster flub... Feingilla was race swapped as well as not studying at arituza. Sorry not picking lol
but wait... Ritchard Armitage as Vilgefortz?
I hate this show more then I hate diabetes, and I&#39;m not even diabetic.
Great video. This just solidifies my choice in getting the books. I want always want to see the world the author intended or as close to it as possible. In contrast the TV show &#39;Legend of the Seeker&#39; which only ran two season, was strongly supported by the author. The series was based on &#39;The Sword of Truth&#39; series written by Terry Goodkind. Fans on the books accepted it, and new fans were then turned on to the books. I wish this would have happened with the Witcher. Well, they can always reboot it and try to do justice to the books in that attempt. We can only hope.
As someone that read the books a long long time ago and just finished watching the series, I gotta say that although I don&#39;t like the show with the exception of Geralt&#39;s scenes, I really don&#39;t think &quot;it&#39;s changed or different from the books&quot; is a good critique regarding the quality of the show. I completely agree about Ciri&#39;s age as, yes, that does change the &quot;relationship&quot; which is important in the story. Although I guess they would need another child actor to have her younger and then later able to become the badass Ciri we love. I actually enjoyed how they managed to fill in the vague/mysterious parts of the story as if they hadn&#39;t they would have had to rely on narrational exposition which would have made the show very boring. Cutting some characters inorder to focus and develop others was a creative choice they made and as writers/producers/directors they should be creative.
I‚Äôm way late, but I‚Äôve a ton of respect for George and wanna simplify many deeply embroiled fan‚Äôs opinions. The Witcher Series is pretty well done. Acting is good for the most part. Combat is intense, settings are not bad. Overall it‚Äôs a well-made Series. But these stories, for the most part, are completely made up by the writers of the series and most of them never happened in the books or the games. At least in the way they‚Äôre shown in the series. Essentially, The Witcher Series is good. But it‚Äôs not really the Witcher.
well marilka wasn&#39;t all made up was she?  as far as i know she only appeared in the last wish as Caldemeyn&#39;s daugther, in the series she just got another role
Meh atleast Witcher got better display than our Paramount Halo TV Series
üòó I wish Tress was cuter still...
IMO i like to think of it as another canon for the Witcher , similar to how the walking dead comics don‚Äôt DRASTICALLY differ than the show , but the show definitely takes liberties when compared to how the original source material was
I‚Äôve started reading the books starting with the sword of destiny
I‚Äôm a newbie no books or games I loved season 1 season 2 was horrible they just dragged the story lines out too long and making yennifer evil enough to sacrifice a child was horrendous
After Season 2 has now come out, I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious that the fault was on the writers and solely them. I have to disagree with your comment on Henry Cavill‚Äôs portrayal of Geralt, as he is also an avid fan of the books and games. His thought process was to make Geralt a ‚Äòtough cookie‚Äô so to speak, so that he can start to open up as the seasons progress, like he has started to at Kaer Morhen with Ciri. He also refused to let the writer make Roaches death a comedic thing, and made sure it was the heartfelt moment between Geralt and Roach that it was, specifically because he knew how people would react. I think the first season was a sort of experiment, a whole Pilot Season, if you will. Its a massive world to recreate and massive task to undertake, so in all honesty they‚Äôve done better than they could‚Äôve. Things could‚Äôve been wayyyyyy worse. I myself had never played the games, nor read the books when I first watched it, but I knew who Geralt and Ciri were etc. So its all really a matter of opinion as they‚Äôre planning 7 seasons and hopefully things will get a lot better.
Not triggered but I think anime fans have this same problem, they want the show/movie to be exactly like the source material but idk if it can be since there is so much information and filler to include. But I also get that making up a whole bunch of fake stuff involving yenefer
Fun fact the girl guiding Geralt in Blaviken in the Netflix series (think her name is Marilka or something) is actually the daughter of Caldemeyn who is the alderman of Blaviken. In the books he is a friend of Geralt and guides him through Blaviken, pretty similar to Marilka in the series. In the tv series Marilka says something about she killing a rat with a fork which is mentioned in the books that Geralt does during a dinner with Caldemeyn and his family.
Henry cavil is a huge witcher fanboy
I‚Äôve never read the books or played the games and even I think the show was weak lol<br>I don‚Äôt remember the names but the one Mage warrior guy who spawns his sword to his side seemed so OP that I was like, ‚ÄúNo way anyone beats him‚Äù and then the Nilfguard commander guy ends up beating him?!?!?! Like, HOW‚Ä¶ and that was just ONE thing I was like ‚Äúthis makes no sense‚Äù.
So my journey was games, show (season 1 and 2), books.<br>And I was honestly impressed with how much season 1 drew from the books. Obviously in terms of Geralt&#39;s story.<br>I can understand how if you came from the books first, you&#39;d be disappointed. But so many adaptations go the way of how season 2 ended up, that I have a renewed appreciation for season 1
I really respect your honesty in these videos. It‚Äôs clear that some viewers would like to only hear praise, and are quick to take offense to anything too critical. I‚Äôve only played The Witcher 3, but absolutely loved the experience. I am very excited to read the books, but haven‚Äôt found my own copies yet... So I have really enjoyed the Netflix series. But I am thankful for your opinion, because it makes me realize that I would prefer to notice these differences myself. So I‚Äôm currently enjoying your lore videos- and will get my hands on the book series asap. And again, I respect your integrity in sharing honest and thoughtful opinions on this content. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, thanks!
Now after watching season 2 I quite like season 1. The ambience was more like the books and games and the story&#39;s were quite accurate.
Agreed 100%
You were right. I disliked the first season as well. The second season is a dumpster fire. Cheers!
Thanks for an interesting review. I think you trust the camera too much. It&#39;s actually an unreliable narrator. For example, in Season 1 Cahir is depicted as evil and Nilfgaard as a peasant backwater because we are seeing them through the viewpoint (primarily) of Cintra and the Mages. This is even in the scenes where we are seeing action directly. Imagine a camera on you constantly and then an edit created to cast you in as unfavourable a light as possible. Viewers often treat the camera&#39;s view naively as some kind of objective lens on the world being described but film-making is often more subtle than that.
I&#39;ve only played Witcher 3, watched the previous two and never read the books. <br><br>I enjoy the show, but even without reading the books, the self-made lore and differences, and overall direction feels awkward. <br>What&#39;s the most disappointing though is the lack of proper bonding to the relationship of the three protagonists. <br>It clearly feels amiss from how it was skipped and rushed unfortunately.
Do the same for season 2!<br><br>I like the show, but I love your knowledge of the universe as well. So I like both really. I love your explanations here but I also enjoyed the show.<br><br>Season 2 was too slow in my opinion though. But I would love to hear about season 2 from someone like you.
Rewatching this in prep for Season 2 and as I release my own video on how to fix the first season. Love your stuff Witcher George. It would be fantastic to have people like you, so knowledgeable on the lore of the games AND books, brought on as consultants for the show. There&#39;s a huge community of very knowledgeable and passionate people on Youtube, making great content, exploring the themes of stories and the art of story telling, making brilliantly done fan short films one low budgets, and yet the gatekeepers of Hollywood apparently don&#39;t want to tap into this. It feels like for the first season at least, Netflix decided  to give this very popular and iconic IP to a group of producers, designers and writers who had never heard of it before, and wanted to use the characters and setting to tell their own story, rather that the actual story as written by Andrzej.
This is the most on point while depressing video. The amount of ridiculous stuff in the show is just absurd.
You should talk to Star Wars Theory. You and he have the same attitudes towards your respective fantasy worlds and have a respectful view on keeping those universes true to the source material because the source material is good the way it is
They should have written the show the way they made the LOTR movie trilogy. Keeping it as close to the source material as possible because the story is excellent and universally loved.the changes they made are because of wokism and trying to diminish white straight male roles and injecting female and POC characters for the sake of ‚Äúequity‚Äù. It‚Äôs pandering patronizing bullshit.
George I respect that your not a fan of the show for me yes I did watch the show first before I read the book heck I bought The Last Wish because I wanted to see the difference between them and I&#39;ll admit this before I read the books I really loved the show but after reading The Last Wish I prefer the books over the show and I recommend the if you haven&#39;t read the books pick them up they are really good.
It reminds me of The Last Of Us Part 2. Glad to hear you don‚Äôt like it. Working my way through it at the moment, it‚Äôs a struggle. Reeks of feminism and tokenism, as well as cringe worthy effort. The books and games sparked moments that brought tears to my eyes, it felt effortless. The show made me confused and irritated.
Great video I agree with the vast majority of your points.<br><br>The girl who guides Geraltnin Blaviken is not really a invention of the show. She mentioned  the  short story The lesser evil but not seen, she is Caldemyn, the Aldermans daughter and she is only 5 years old in the story.<br><br>For some reason the show runner decided to replace the Alderman(who we do not see in the show) with his daughter and also have Renfriamp take her hostage .Maybe they wanted to show Geralt protecting a young girl
When the show came out, I had played a little bit of The Witcher 3 and read a part of one of the books.  I knew just enough to be vaguely competent about the series as a whole, and thought, barring a few odd casting choices and the change of Ciri&#39;s father into some nobody, that the show was pretty good.<br><br>I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve spent time watching your backlog of content before watching this because now I 100% agree: the show got a <b>lot</b> wrong.  Sadly, I think a lot of it was changed for empowerment and whatnot, which is ridiculous if you know anything about the characters as written.<br><br>Henry Cavill was probably the only perfect casting choice for the show as he has played all the games and read all the books.  He loves the series and did his absolute best to portray it honestly.  I just wish he had been able to get the writers of the show to give a damn.
Actually  the author  of the books as sued cd porokt red over the games and hates the games and has said the game isn&#39;t a continuing  the books also the author  of the books  has already  said they like how Netflix is taking  his opinion  in casting  and stoy telling  Netflix is trying  to go more towards  books because  the games aren&#39;t cannon and that is coming  from the one who made the witcher universe
I like the show but I don‚Äôt love it because they screwed up a lot but I think it‚Äôs actually inspired not based entirely so I‚Äôm willing to give it a try like the games. What I can‚Äôt forgive is how they changed the Dryads, Geralt and Ciri‚Äôs story in Brokilon and Fringilla Vigo‚Äôs casting because they flipped her description from the books entirely. She won‚Äôt blush anymore and also they made Nilfgaard like the Eternal Fire from Witcher 3 they‚Äôve become fanatics and this group of religious zealots.
Yeah I&#39;m kind of in agreement with you there George, as someone who has been a fan of the Witcher lore (both the games and novels) for almost 7 years now, I feel they&#39;re changing way too much, and not for the better, but I am in agreement with you on the chemistry between Geralt and Dandelion
I think you are hung up on the fact that this isn&#39;t the books just an adaptation. I think you didn&#39;t go in with an open mind for the show you wanted the books in live action. It isn&#39;t Frangilla that makes Nilfgaard strong (having some knowledge of the books and games) the right full heir took over the thrown (who we haven&#39;t gotten to yet because he is very important) and It&#39;s hinted at slightly slightly that they (Nilfgaard) are united and has a clear vision of their goal. We also learn through conversation Cintra is just just bad as Nilfgaard. Episode 6 is the reason the ending of episode matters. Episode 6 is about being a parent and children as Geralt has been hiding from his problems when he learns of Nilfgaards coming attack he becomes responsible for Ciri and understands he must take care of her because of the law of surprise Ciri is rightfully his and he must take care of her. Half of the show is expanding on the small mentions of what happened and they are trying to fill in the gaps just because it isn&#39;t talked about much doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be shown.
thank you
can you review the vesimer anime movie trailer because I would like to see your thoughts on it
Did anyone else notice how they sort of combined some story arcs? For example, &quot;Cahir&quot; is actually a combination of Cahir and Menno Coehoorn in terms of leading the Nilfgardian army but also hunting down Ciri. I will say that in terms of Nilfgard it&#39;s a bit more ambiguous in terms of things, like yes it does make it seem like they&#39;re &quot;backwater&quot; and &quot;worthless until Fringilla showed up&quot; but at a couple points you see that they mention the reason Nilfgard was turned around was because Emyhr returned and claimed his throne, the mages just like to think they&#39;re the reason for everything happening because they&#39;re &quot;all powerful&quot; when its only because Yen had taken her place at Aedirn that she implied her not helping, plus most of the sorcerers hate her in this. Now I&#39;d imagine they&#39;re trying to be mysterious with Emyhr&#39;s other identity which is why they only mention him occasionally, also Fringilla basically worships the &quot;White Flame&quot; when talking with Cahir and reveres him like a god, would she really claim responsibility for taking Nilfgard when she holds him in such high regard?
Honestly when you were listing all the things you liked, I was like, same lmao that&#39;s about all I liked about it too oofff
I watched 6 minutes of the first episode of Netflix&#39;s The Witcher, and immediately went blind. I spent the rest of the night vomiting into a toilet, and vowed never to try again. I warned myself not to look..
I hated the show. such a poor interpretation and so, so disappointing
I screamed so loud!<br><br>I would like to, maybe, create a reaction to this video one day as my bf really doesn‚Äôt give a crap or a toad about my Witcher interests comparably to myself.<br><br>I agreed with SO MUCH that you stated in this video. <br>I feel like I am still going to give the show a try as it is better than nothing. My morbid curiosity also wishes to know how much more they could really skin the characters. <br><br>Visually, the show is more or less beautiful.
No production company could live up the witcher like cd projekt red did..
Your channel is one of my favorites! I appreciate you being honest and having proof of the reasons why there were things about the show you didnt like. If there were ppl that attacked you just because of your opinion, theyre pretty shitty ppl. What you said about the series is typically what happens with anything going from book to tv, or from videogame series to tv. I wish I wouldve found this sooner because AS SOON AS they announced the show way back when, my 1st thought was &quot;I wonder what WitcherGeorge would think about this.&quot; I hope you&#39;ve been well man, peace and blessings!
The show is absolute garbage. I would even go as far as to say that you are not a real Witcher fan if you don&#39;t hate it.
I am not satisfied with Triss&#39; actress....needed someone more bold
The fact that you had to do that intro segment just shows how toxic the fanbase is lmao
Well, I can agree with you all the video! The first time I saw the series, I kind of &quot;like it&quot;, because I was so excited to see my favourite saga in a TV show, but when a really paid attention to all the things you mentioned, the I realiced that that&#39;s my same opinion! <br>I really love your videos bro! Greetings from Mexico! :D &lt;3
It felt like the writers had no faith in the strength of the source material. This show felt like a shadow of the books. Compare that to the show The Expanse where the changes from the books made sense and only added to the strength of the story and characters.
I don&#39;t know the Witcher world as in depth as you do, but I have read all the books and played the games. That being said, I totally agree with you, but I think I was more annoyed than you at some of the changes and decisions they made with the show. Heck, even the CGI looks terrible in some scenes, for a show with this gigantic budget. Unfortunately I lost all my excitement about it and won&#39;t be watching season 2. <br><br>Thanks for your videos man, great work.
Y.e.s. Thank. you.
Good review. I love the show, while I disagree with a bunch of your takes, I totally get why you don&#39;t like it. Sucks it isn&#39;t what you would have liked it to be.
Yes! Yes! I agree with you 100%,the series felt like a let down almost like they didn‚Äôt even take the time to read the books and learn more of the Witcher world and the characters.I hated the way they portrayed Cahir and what was up with Triss? I could go on and on
Have you considered listening to the audiobook for LOTR? I did for The Witcher, the narrator was superb. I listened at bedtime and fell asleep so it took ages
I watched the show first and then played the witcher 3. Honestly the game is on a diffrent level but the show still has my interest.
I know this is a year old but I got recommended it now, so I just wanna state my opinions on it. I really liked the show. I‚Äôve read most of the books and played the games. The books are incredibly overrated. Maybe it‚Äôs just a bad translation (I might try them in German instead of English if it is the translation), but they honestly just get so boring. The writing and phrasing are just incredibly repetitive, and the whole portrayal just isn‚Äôt nearly as interesting or engaging as the games or show. I would say that it it‚Äôs best, the Witcher books are a bit below the Eragon books. At its average though, I‚Äôm about as engaged as I am with bloody Harry Potter, and yet people praise the Witcher books to be rivals of Tolkien. The books were okay, but honestly fairly dull compared to how the show and games portrayed the story. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm perfectly fine with both the games and the show taking liberties and doing their own kind of thing. And in both cases (games in particular) they succeeded in making the story more interesting. And this isn‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt like reading. Books are probably my favourite medium for telling stories. My dad read me fantasy books when I was super young, which led me to read the Hobbit when I was 8 years old. I‚Äôve been way into the fantasy genre since. But I didn‚Äôt pick up the Witcher books until after the games (before the show), and honestly the books just don‚Äôt convey the epic story that the games do. Witcher 3 is probably my favourite game ever, and everybody said the books were just as good, but once I got to the books they just disappointed me. So I don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs different from the books, in fact I think it‚Äôs a good thing in the case of the show, because I find the show far more interesting and engaging than the books. Also Henry Cavill plays a great Geralt. I do wish they showed more signs in the show though, and more note of the alchemy rather than just an offhand 2 seconds of him drinking a potion before a fight. Ciri being older is fine cause children as actors is terrible. Nilfgaard being a backwater was kinda dumb I agree. Nilfgaard using black magic is fine, cause even in the books I see them as a disgusting oppressive regime that built its own morality to justify its evils. Emhyr is far more a monster than the griffin you killed in white orchard. And as for magic, the equivalent exchange is a far better system in my opinion. The system in the books was just too loose and undefined. I think the Eragon books have the best system for magic I‚Äôve ever seen in a fantasy world, but Witcher feels a lot closer to the opposite end of the magic system spectrum, Harry Potter. The girl in Blaviken  was kinda like a replacement for the alderman from the original story, and honestly the interactions between Geralt and Marilka were so much better than the dry boring interactions with the alderman in the books. Also it was the other mages saying that Yen would‚Äôve kept Nilfgaard trashy, but there‚Äôs implications that she wouldn‚Äôt have actually done that, and that Nilfgaard still would‚Äôve grown under her. To the point with the Star Wars example, I think that was a pretty poor example. Remaking a movie and adapting a book to a movie/show are incredibly different. As for Lord of the Rings, they absolutely changed a lot of stuff in the movies. Some fans have problems with it, I actually don‚Äôt because they made changes to better fit the medium, and the changes still worked and the result was just as good as the source. Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite books, and the movies are some of my favourite movies. The Hobbit is a different matter though. <br><br>TLDR: Witcher books are boring, I‚Äôm fine with the changes the show makes cause the show is more interesting and engaging.
I 100% agree with you in every way
the show is disgusting, it is almost like some weird revenge against the game and the books!
I watched the show not knowing anything about the Witcher. At the end of the season I thought &quot;Hey, the show was kinda meh but there are some interesting things here, let&#39;s check out if the book is any good.&quot;<br>After reading the books... Holy crap how did Netflix manage to make such an absolute dumpster fire? It&#39;s like they deliberately ruined everything of importance in the original story.
a year later reflection...the cast was horrible. that was my worst gripe. i dont believe them, and the aesthetic changes to iconic characters (nitpicky) just annoyed me, and didnt help. i liked henry cavil, i think its a direction issue on his geralt that made people hate him, he fits the part, triss and yennefer as well as fringilla seem weird
It wasn‚Äôt the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen, but it was better than 90% of anything else that‚Äôs available. There was enough of Geralt saying ‚Äúfuck‚Äù to make it entertaining
I reread The Last Wish and some of Sword of Destiny before re-watching, and my goodness they streamlined quite a bit, even taking some liberties. To some extent I understand it, budget constraints and all. Cutting the main players of an episode from 8 to 4 can save a lot of money. But there are other episodes, mainly the 1st and 4th (child surprise) where they change things without a justifiable cause, as it&#39;s not cut content for budget reasons. It&#39;s still there, just different. And it&#39;s worse almost every time. <br><br>The books are very objective in construct, practically screenplays, so almost everything is explained in dialogue in the books instead of narration. So the template is there, and it&#39;s good, but somehow they explain the Law of Surprise worse in the show. On top of altering the source material for ego&#39;s sake, there are some other writing flaws. In a first season that spans approximately 40-80 years (Geralt and Yenn are both 80-100ish), why is it never made explicitly clear up front that Yenn and Geralt are old and semi-immortal? A few throw away &quot;It&#39;s been a while&quot; and &quot;when you live as long as me...&quot; lines are not sufficient. It doesn&#39;t help that they did nothing to make the mortal characters, such as Calanthe and Eist look older (or even Jaskier). They look the same 15 years later. A non-book reader is going to be confused as hell. Fortunately this wont be as much an issue moving forward. <br><br>I did like the humanization of Yenn, even with them straight up skipping the middle of her story due to time constraints, it made her a very sympathetic character. But I think they missed the mark with Ciri and Geralt. With Ciri they can still fix it, but with Geralt...it&#39;s hard to put my finger on it, but he&#39;s not quite right. It&#39;s so close, but not quite. Part of it is the terrible fight scenes. Other than a few exceptions (episode 1 final fight) he looks so damn slow and gets knocked around so much that he would have been dead 60 years ago. In the books he survives because he is agile and fast as the wind. You take a hit from a monster and you die. But more on the character...they just didn&#39;t quite capture his humanity. The easiest example is him trying to save Jaskier in the Wish episode. In The Last Wish book chapter he does have a genuine earnestness to save Jaskier because he is actually his best friend. And that is also there in the show, but it&#39;s more brushed off in favor of comical lines, because Jaskier is a comic relief in the show, which is not really the case in the books. In the episode 2 story in the books Geralt tries to bargain to have Jaskier  set free from the Elves and they only kill Geralt, but Jaskier refuses and demands to be killed with his comrade even though he is scared shitless. We never see that side of Jaskier, and by consequence never see that side of Geralt. There are a bunch of other little things that bother me, but this is already too long.
You must absolutely HATE the marvel and dc movies lol
Hi WitcherGeorge.<br>I&#39;m relatively new to your channel, and I really have to say I&#39;m very impressed with what you do. I&#39;ve read the books, and I greatly enjoyed them. The games I haven&#39;t played yet, and with the show I&#39;m on my third viewing.<br><br>I&#39;m not an expert on witcher lore, but I find it to be more nuanced, interesting and vivid than that of many fantasy worlds I&#39;ve delved into.<br><br>My opinion is that the books, in most ways, are simply superior to the show. The characters are different and more consistent in their actions (Though Yennefer&#39;s back story isn&#39;t terribly well developed in the books) the world building is far more impressive, and the political and military aspects were both much more intricate and more realistic. The non-human races are better formed and fleshed out, and the magic system is more mysterious and it&#39;s potential, greater.<br><br>That being said, I truly love the show. There are big issues that are harder to overlook, such as some problems with the storytelling: Renfri, though well acted, has very questionable judgement. It isn&#39;t even clear why she has her men attack Geralt in the first place. Jaskier doesn&#39;t appear any different when they make the big jump in the timeline. The combat tactics and armour are often of dubious effectiveness. A lot of the world building is done through exposition. These are some of the most striking flaws for me. <br><br>Honestly, though, I think that the good outweighs the bad. I think Geralt is the highlight, which is a (rightfully) common opinion, so I won&#39;t elaborate. Ciri I also very much like, because of her quieter strength, as well as for the times when she unwittingly uses her magical powers. I like her whole arc of dispossession, and her longing for a family and, more particularly, Geralt. I think it is appropriate for her to be older, maybe because she is more prepared for the immense obstacles before her. Like Nilfgaard. They&#39;re quite a problem for her. Her encounter with the dryads is too short and, perhaps, insignificant in the show, however.<br><br>Yennefer I like, because of her strength and charisma. Her transformation is torture, and she wants to undergo it for the sake of power. Interesting, and considering what her life is like until then, perhaps realistic. She wants control over herself and others. I find Yen intriguing, but hard to relate to. She is well acted in the show.<br><br>Cahir is very different in the show. He is more involved with the fighting itself, but also some intelligence work (If you could consider his hiring of the doppler<br>intelligent). I like him, though.<br><br>I also like the spectacle of the combat, the costumes (Even the Nilfgaardian armour), the general atmosphere, the soundtrack, and I thought that the acting was very good. I think that Freya Allan and Anya Chalotra are rising stars.<br><br>Anyhow, thank you for reading my comment. Most of you may disagree, but that&#39;s not a problem. I try to respect everyone&#39;s opinions, please do the same for mine.
The writers said they made these changes so that you don&#39;t already know everything that&#39;s going to happen. They want the opportunity for cliff hangers and nail bitting moments and if you already know whats going to happen those moments won&#39;t work. I can understand that but I agree with you, I would love to see a show thats completely parallel to the books. <br><br>Hopefully they listen to feedback and season 2 is more parallel to the books. Im completely willing to accept  contradictions to season 1 for the rest of the show to be accurate.
Did the showrunner even read the books?!
I like Witcher idea but it felt like they were copying BbC Merlin and they couldn‚Äôt do it with much more budget. Merlin did more character development. I can totally imagine the golden dragon story with Merlin and having so much more emotion in it. I understand that they have changed yennifer but it was a great story for a female character ciri is a princess and special from the beginning but Yen was not and it‚Äôs hopeful and encouraging to see such a female character.
zeze
The show got me into the games which got me into the books so I don&#39;t mind the changes but I feel you went through what I went through in S5-S8 of GoT
sao abridged

thanks for the review! you&#39;ve gained a new follower :)
never gonna give you up
&quot;Gets introduced to the series because both the show&quot;<br>Hey this is very interesting<br><br>&quot;Plays games&quot;<br>Wow, I see why a lot of people liked this.<br><br>&quot;Reads books&quot;<br>Oh no, the show ruined so many things!!
It‚Äôs just too many changes. Not only to the story and development, also casting, looks and environments. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the Witcher universe you want to get lost in to me. And I rewatched it as well and still just couldn‚Äôt get into it. <br><br>The interactions between yennefer and geralt were also really cringe in the show, which I never experienced in the books and game.  <br>Also people are mentioning yennefers age, and then saying it‚Äôs because of magic. But how about in the context of her having a parental role in Ciri‚Äôs life while being almost the same age as Ciri :/ <br><br>Anyway I agree with you, it‚Äôs a dumpster fire and painful to watch.
Totally agree with you
oversimplified
Peaple rushing to every vedio that critics the show already disliking it before watching , no respect for other people&#39;s opinions  , they want to force you to like it , angry infantile fanbois and fangirls roaming like a plague on every platform, its sad to see what out generation has turned out to be , another vedio I watched that said the series is trash was taken down in a heart beat, because it spoke badly yet truly of feminism and diversity , criticising even critics and journalists , like you know better , like the only truth that exists is the truth you know , enjoy watching the shit netflix gives you and I promise shit is all they ever ganna provide
I totally agree with your analyst of season 1. I&#39;ve read the books and played the witcher 2 and 3 multiple times and the show is way off. The actresses who play yennefer and triss don&#39;t properly depict the yennefer or triss from the novels and game. At least the show triss is beautiful but yennefer is suppose to be beautiful, she&#39;s very underwhelming in that aspect. Also I hate the Star Wars sequel trilogy series. Glad George Lucas took over the series again. I will continue to watch it since I want to support the world of the Witcher. Can&#39;t wait for blood origin.
New here! <br>I watched the Netflix show (not all of it) then went and watched a bunch of YouTube videos on the differences between the games, the books, and the show. Thank you for your honest opinion. I now know to never finish the show and read the books instead. Really appreciate it and the damaged control comment.
The Witcher Netflix show is like a burger. But the cook decided to remove the lettuce, the cheese, and the onions, and substitute it with pasta, broccoli and yogurt. Pasta, broccoli, and yogurt are not bad, but they don&#39;t belong in a burger.
I seriously thought the actor for ciri was 11 years old
I‚Äôve never read the books, and I‚Äôve only played The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. I absolutely loved the game and have done 4 or 5 play throughs. It‚Äôs tied for my all time favorite game. Lol <br><br>I enjoyed the show, but hated how they changed some characters (that I know from the game) to fit the SJW agenda that‚Äôs plaguing us right now. The woman playing Fringilla is a terrible actress. (And before someone gets butt hurt..my wife is black) Other than the SJW pandering, I liked the show and I‚Äôm cautiously looking forward to the next season. <br><br>Thx for sharing
haschak sisters
stop being wishy washy and trying to make apologies for your heart felt views..it comes off weak..and look at the nay votes.. the most no votes you ever got..it is embarassing to see you do this..should have stated your reasons once and then explain your differences..
I feel like Yen&#39;s &quot;backstory&quot; should probably be restricted to maybe the bar talk while we get Gerald&#39;s story, but after watching the show you do make some good points that could have been better.  Gerald&#39;s emotions in the show are either too much or nonexistent. Overall it&#39;s okay for me so far, just to much to fast.
I really liked the show. Boom. Done.
I think you misunderstood the situation about Yennefer and Fringilla. They wanted to send Yen because she&#39;s not someone who is just blindly following orders so she wouldn&#39;t have let things get out of control like this. They wanted to send someone who can control Nilfgrad. I disagree about a couple of other things as well, but ye the show had flaws. I still enjoyed it though and i&#39;m looking forward to season two.
caramelldansen
Every time I watch the game play throughs I will always imgaine Henry as geralt because he was so perfect as the charecter. And anyone who disagrees is wrong. Can‚Äôt wait to see more of Henry in the show he‚Äôs the best
The other castings were great too but I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the casting of triss marigold. I think Alexandra Breckinridge would have been a better choice to play triss. Also I do love the chemistry with Henry and Anya as geralt and yennifer but i like geralt with triss too and Henry cavill and Alexandra Breckinridge would have had amazing chemistry too
Henry cavill was perfect as Geralt and I always loved Henry as an actor and I was so happy when he got cast for the role.
I loved the the Witcher Netflix show and it was great after watching the show it got me into the games and books
Why all the downvotes, this review is on point.  Especially as someone whose played the games and read all the books.
I would love a really nitpicky video on the show.
Simply put if you went through the books and play the games the series may not be for you . most of the people that like this I&#39;ve noticed are those that had no inclination of the universe prior
I&#39;ve read the books, played the games (except tw1) and obviously watched the show, I kinda like it, but knowing, like you said, what actually happens, I cant help but pick things out that are wrong while watching it
They should have named the show, The sorcerer Woke Hunt(BLM friendly)...<br>The only parts of the Show that are bearable are the Geralt scenes and some of Geralt with Dandelion(Yes Dandelion not fucking Jaskier)!
I really liked it, problems and all.
the biggest flaw in the series is the excessive politically correct, please sign, let&#39;s save Triss Merigold. <a href=""http://chng.it/ydS7Dxkh9B"">http://chng.it/ydS7Dxkh9B</a><br><br><br>sorry for my english, it&#39;s a second language
It would have failed if not for Henry&#39;s passion
I loved this show and only found your channel because after watching it I wanted to know everything about the world.
For me the show acted the way the 2009 Star Trek movie did. After I watched that I wanted to watch the original series and became a Star Trek fan. With The Witcher, I watched the show first and then decided I wanted to read the books. I have noticed a lot of difference in the first two books versus the show, but I do feel it was still something that could bring more people into the fandom the same way the 2009 Star Trek did. All that being said, I‚Äôm always interested to see people who know MUUCCCHHHH more about a fandom than I do have to say about content like this, but I do think this has some benefits that you may have over looked.
The golden dragon was the worst CGI dragon I&#39;ve ever seen. And overall, not having read the books or played the game, I thought the show was awful.
I was finally able to watch the series and I have to agree with you. As I watched I just kept scratching my head and thinking &quot;why change that?&quot; I didn&#39;t even recognize Cahir as Cahir at first because he was so different.
I learned about The Witcher when I saw the show. And, because I didn&#39;t know anything about this universe, I went on YouTube to find out about The Witcher universe, cause I didn&#39;t get anything from the show and I found Witcher George&#39;s channel and subscribed to it. So: there&#39;s a positive thing!üëç You should work together with the show runnersüòâ
The season is absolute trash, except for the first episode.
Idk why you‚Äôre so worried we‚Äôd disagree with you. Obviously if we watch your channel we know most of the lore and were thrown back while watching this ‚Äúinterpretation‚Äù of the Witcher. THEY FUCKED UP! And we‚Äôre all upset about it. Ppl on forums that like this show don‚Äôt know shit. This was such a good opportunity to make an amazing show and they dropped the ball big time. Maybe season 2 will be better but we need to make some noise
Lead writer needs to be fired and they should hire u as a consultant
I‚Äôm super disappointed that they left out the Sword of Destiny story. It‚Äôs probably my favorite story from the original anthologies
I don‚Äôt know enything about Witcher when i start watching series. The series bored me, i was thinking why this crap has so many fans.
kda popstar
The entire first season is a world introduction as far as theyve come, Im excited to see where they go in the future, especially now that they are going to retread the rest of &quot; The Last Wish&quot; in season 2 .  I just want to see him talk with Nivellen, I hope the effects wont be that bad.
I haven&#39;t read the books or played the game and four episodes in, I think the Netflix show is a hot mess. The Cintra flashbacks were very confusing, too much whispering and mumbling particularly in episode one left me mystified. Characters turning up out of the blue with no explanation and the occasional feminist monologue - Yennefer tells the dead baby girl that as a girl she&#39;s better off dead then later we suddenly find out that Yennefer wants to have a baby. Queen Calanthe is a foul mouthed, murderous warrior queen who jokes about massacring &#39;upstart villages&#39; but is still suffering in a man&#39;s world.(I hope this stuff isn&#39;t in the books.) I really hated Dandelion (I&#39;m hoping he&#39;s better portrayed in the books.) Finally, &#39;The White Wolf&#39; - is this homage to Michael Moorcock&#39;s immortal Elric of Melnibone ? Still, imo, the greatest fantasy hero ever conceived. Great review dude but I don&#39;t think you need to apologize at all for your opinions.
I just think that those who just played the games more like the show while the more hardcore fans of the books and lore are all upset
I got into the series because of the show. I am now drinking up all of the content I can find related to the franchise. So I will concede the points you made. Loving the content you provide and I hope we can some day discuss the series a bit! :)
all book fans hate the series &quot;SJWitcher&quot;. read it and you will understand how bad it is.<br>I &#39;m sorry for my bad English
I hated how weak the mages were portrayed. Like at the battle of Sodden, Triss can only grow plants for some reason and at the golden dragons cave, Yen doesn‚Äôt use her magic at all and just uses sword fighting. Like these are powerful mages why are you downplaying them?
I think I can understand your point. If I was someone who read the books and played the game first , maybe I wouldn&#39;t have liked the show as much. Since for me it was the other way around I actually like more the flawed characters from the TV show than the ones from game. They seem more real to me... if that makes sense... (I&#39;m currently reading the 2nd book) I&#39;ve been playing the game and reading the books since I finished watching the series because I&#39;ve liked the show that much. At least for us plebs who didn&#39;t know about it, üòÇ we can now enjoy the other source materials too because of the show. (sorry for my broken English. I&#39;m not native)
I agree with you WitcherGeorge and I support everything you said in here and furthur more value your opinion as a credible relivant person to have commentary on the topic. Take care dude. Keep staying you.
I mean from someone who only knew about this because my friend played the Witcher 3. I just think it&#39;s meh. Just meh.
The golden dragon ep was shiitt
even Henry for me he&#39;s seems to try very hard
I think the show did a good job with the story as they achieved what they set out to do in 8 episodes. That was 3 storylines they weaved into one within 8 episodes. While I completely understand the notion that it&#39;s not a faithful adaptation, you also have to understand that there are a lot more restrictions with a series on the screen compared to the books. You have to realise that these series aren&#39;t set in stone, Andrzej Sapowski was probably going to finish the Witcher books one way or another as he had creative freedom on what to do but the showrunners have no idea whether the series will be 1 season or 10 seasons long. They NEED to cut out and change things for the masses to make the show less dense and easier to watch. There&#39;s a reason more people would have watched the series than read the books or even play the games. Point is, whatever the showrunners would have done, they won&#39;t be able to please everyone. Doesn&#39;t make it a bad series though.
I think showing Yennefer&#39;s backstory and adding to it was actually a very good idea. Books have the luxury of seeing a character&#39;s inner thoughts and writers can always weave them quite seamlessly into current events. In film that can seem extremely jarring and out of place if a character references previously completely unseen backstory out of nowhere when the story is dealing with a different problem. Better to set it up and show it earlier so they can be far more subtle about it while weaving it into later stories.
Yeah easily my two most hated changes were Fringilla and Nilfgaard. Firstly the Empire of Nilfgaard was always the most dangerous of the nations on the continent due to its sheer size and wealth. They are not evil dark lords using evil magic and ruled by fanatical ideology as they are presented. The only difference between them and the Northern Realms really is they have more weight to throw around and so more often come across as arseholes when they exercise that power.<br><br>Fringilla. What the fuck? What is she the right hand of fucking Sauron? Not only did they decimate her entire backstory, but she is completely evil and not in the slightest bit nuanced. And how in the hell does she, almost alone, overwhelm the sorcerers of Sodden Hill? In the books she is clearly viewed as exceptionally dangerous like many of the Lodge&#39;s sorcerers, particularly because she personally burned Yennefer&#39;s eyes out, but she&#39;s not a fucking goddess. Also it was never personal. She was never some fanatical psychopath. She was a mage in Nilfgaard where they have far less rights and was sent to war. It was nothing personal and later on its shown that despite just doing her duty she felt bad for hurting Yennefer when she gave her the idea of what spell to use to escape Monte Calvo castle.<br><br>Also Brokilon was an essential part of Geralt and Ciri&#39;s story, most crucially because Geralt didn&#39;t actually find out she was the child meant for him until they&#39;d already had time to bond. As far as he knew this was some random child he figured he&#39;d keep alive if he could and the two grew to like each other purely due to being who they are, putting the whole destiny thing aside for a moment. This creates context for the rest of the entire story. Geralt isn&#39;t just doing what he feels he&#39;s supposed to. He cares for Ciri and wants to help her. Destiny just happened to line up with that.
There was just no character interaction, the little conversations and actions that give us insights into the characters mind, intentions, feelings. It&#39;s like the directors just wanted to check off a list of the &quot;cool&quot; conflict climaxy bits, big fights, big magical explosions, dragon, etc. None of the mundane stuff you need to learn who characters are and build feelings for them were there.<br><br>Edit: I think it&#39;s apt to say, this was a cheesy fantasy themed action series, not a thoughtful, carefully crafted world with characters you really care about.
This show was so bad. It was about as cringe worthy as something you&#39;d find on the CW. I liked Henry Cavil as Geralt, the guy who played Dandelion, and the girl who played Ciri. Everything else was just bad. Cahir was completely butchered as a character. He felt like a fucking Saturday morning cartoon villain. Hopefully season 2 will be better but I&#39;m just gonna read the books and play the games again.
Thank you, your thinking basically reflect mine! A lot of people told me &quot;come on it is a show just enjoy it, who cares if it is not exactly like the books!&quot; But that&#39;s not the point! As a show per se the witcher may be decent but as an adaptation IT SUCKS. It really sucks. The writing of characters and events is most of the time inaccurate or bad, too many characters have changed or have been cut out, the core of the whole saga thrown in the trashbin.  Everything&#39;s so superficial it hurts!
Literally everyone in this comment section bum licks each other over the show not being the same as the games or books. It doesn‚Äôt have to be the same as your individual nerdy interpretation and it never would have been because it‚Äôs your own view. Stop criticising the cast because of the fact that they don‚Äôt all look how they do in the books because it doesn‚Äôt matter. They all do an amazing job and stand out in their own way. People are hating that the story isn‚Äôt the same as the books but the games aren‚Äôt the same either. They are all similar in some ways and different in others but are all portraying the same story. Yes there are some flaws in this show and nothing is ever perfect so don‚Äôt be pricks about the irrelevant details. Loads of the cast were really nervous to present this series in front of this fan base because of the harsh criticism that they were aware would come whatever they did. If this show doesn‚Äôt match how you would have liked it to be then fuck off and find another show to watch. The one reason why I‚Äôm writing this is because the negative views that I keep seeing actually affect the cast and the way that this show is made. Imagine being brave enough to take up a difficult role of creating this show, and spending months trying to make it perfect so that the fan base can be happy, and then getting a punch in the face because someone‚Äôs skin colour is different to how it is written in the books. Grow up
I‚Äôve never played the Witcher and generally had no interest in it. But watching the show made me realize how amazing the universe can be. And I plan on buying the games and books. I understand that books and games and shows are different, and I think that I will have the same views after learning everything from the books and games. But for someone who‚Äôs never played or read anything about the Witcher this show is pretty good at enthralling me into the universe
Story was really confusing with all the flashbacks
If you are looking for criticism, you spend way too much time apologizing and worrying about politeness. You can get that point across much more succinctly. As this is you seem to spend half the runtime entreating to our manner. Just make your point and stand on it.
Heavy on plot, light on story. They keep showing events while missing the point of them. All I feel for this show I bring with me. Absolutely none of my emotional resonance was obtained while watching.
Hey George, I liked the show as a generic fantasy. I‚Äôve also played all the games and I love the Witcher. I have to say, your opinion very clearly depicts the show, and you are easily one of the foremost Witcher experts! Thank you for all your content!
Ok but I won‚Äôt complain about Yennefer having lots of screen time üòå
Thing is.... The game is an adaptation of the books, and the games don&#39;t stay too neat with the written lore... Sooooo.... Did you die when that happened?
as someone who&#39;s reading the books and playing the games after watching the show, I&#39;m almost definitely still going to be a fan of the show literally just because of dandelion and geralt&#39;s dynamic. even when i watched the show without knowing more from games/books i skipped through most of the yennifer scenes and only rlly watched half of ciris scenes just bc they were kind of... rlly boring? lol I&#39;m planning on rewatching the show once i finish the first few books but i feel like thats probably a bad idea literally just bc of the fact i might start to dislike it even more üòî
love your review and the way you explain it. got a valid point of view keep doing the thing you love to do!
I just watched first episode and hope the rest of the season is better. I really wanted  to like it as I love the game but sadly thought the episode was below average. Really hoping it gets better.
I really only ever played the Witcher 3 and didn&#39;t read the books nor played witcher 1 and 2, but even I wasn&#39;t a fan of the show. To me it seemed as if they had this rich source material and made a mediocre medieval magic show about it
Listen George, this Video was great and very informing! <br><br>I missed many things and I am sure, that many suffered the same fate. I value your imput, please continue with this kind of content for it&#39;s really important to draw Knowledge from many Sources so one&#39;s own opinion doesnt get frail and biased!
I love this content sir üòå
I don‚Äôt like what they did with Fringilla Vigo... Call me racist and Hitler incarnate, but I don‚Äôt think you should sacrifice a well written and established character in exchange for diversity. Fringilla is supposed to be Anna Henrietta‚Äôs cousin? And Emhyr‚Äôs relative? They are really just complicating things for no reason, if they want to make the cast more diverse, then create new characters like what they did with the Elf.
Just a little piece of my mind:<br>I‚Äôve just watched the Netflix show and now I‚Äôm so intrigued I‚Äôm going to start reading the books and playing the games. And I guarantee thousands of other people are going to do the same or have already done because of this show.
Late to comment and watch this one... I started watching a while back and, well, did go on to another video when I heard the beginning. I have come back to it, and I do get it... but I also wanted to share my experience. Dunno if you or anyone will see it, but here goes. I enjoyed the series. To be quite honest, it was basically my entry point to the Witcher universe. I know of the games, but had never played the games or read the books. The series- well it may not be faithful to the source material(s)- it me. I have now spent literally hundreds of hours playing Witcher 3  and it‚Äôs dlcs (no good way to play 1 &amp; 2 yet), reading the books, watching YouTube play through and lore videos. This series opened up a whole new world for me, so... despite it‚Äôs faults, and while I now get the issues many people more familiar with the source material before seeing it have with the show... I suspect I will always have a huge soft spot for it. It was my portal to the Witcherverse.
Be as critical and as harsh as you need to be feck how others try to enforce themselves on you ive recently got in the books due to how dissapointing the show was. As long as the criticism is vaild and there is a clear point to be made.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=17m14s"">17:14</a> however your argument that use you against the star star wars remake can also be used against the last jedi because of how they did 180 his character for no good reason and which didnt make sense with what his character was and the time argument doesnt really work due to his experiences as a character.
Agree with alot when it comes to character development.  But I will say I feel the ciri stories early on are for people who havnt read the books, and would be confused more than they already are over more jump around than there are already. Love the show though still, even after reading the books. Good adaptation.  But some solid points.
good opinion! coming from the game i totally had fun watching the series but i get why you wouldn&#39;t. if i read the book i wouldnt either after all the details you mentioned.
Ok i tried to overlook the forced diversity casting and watch the whole season and i wish i didn&#39;t do it.The writing in this show is like bad fan fiction , big waste of time.
I&#39;ve been aware of the Witcher series of games for a while, but I didn&#39;t really have time to get into a new series of games, so I never really paid attention to it. I knew Witcher 3 was considered one of the best games of the decade, but my computer was incapable of playing it so, again, I just paid it no mind (I haven&#39;t had a console in about 5 years, so that wasn&#39;t an option either).<br><br>And then the Witcher show came out and, man, I just fell in love with the world that they built. I have since bought a new computer that is capable of playing Witcher 3 and I decided to buy it. I didn&#39;t have time or the will to play both Witcher 1 and 2 before diving into Witcher 3, so I started exploring the witcher wiki and youtube videos.<br><br>After almost a month of reading and watching reviews and recaps of the first two games as well as the books, I was really excited to learn that the show tells stories like the beginning of the First Northern War, the battle with the Striga and how Geralt became known as the Butcher of Blaviken.<br><br>At the same time, I was very surprised how differently Faltest was portrayed in the show vs the other lore. In the show, he was portrayed as this creepy, pathetic, feeble fool who Geralt pretty much hated. But in the games, he seems...much better. At least in Geralt&#39;s eyes. And in fighting shape, despite the games being years after the show. <br><br>Overall, I love the show because it introduced me to the world, but I can see the discrepancies and I look forward to learning even more about the world once I start playing Witcher 3. I even leave open the possibility of going back and playing Witcher 1 and 2 afterwards (although I hear they are mechanically much wonkier and annoying to play).
Makes a lot of sense but it‚Äôs a show and they need content to make it look good just like the Witcher games when they were being made the developers ended up having a game with 100+ hours. I feel like I‚Äôm not against your opinion because it is not an opinion it‚Äôs just facts. It‚Äôs hard trying to copy a story that already has rule set that‚Äôs why the games were very good it was after the books.
Sorry you don&#39;t like Yennefer. I actually found her more interesting, and surprising how much I found her inspiring.     I&#39;ve seen some of her cut scenes from the games, and honestly I find her not very much interesting. If I want to see a too cool for school woman I can get that from a Bond film.
As a book reader, I&#39;m ok with the Yennefer origins. Show is an adaptation. Agreed with the Fringilla aspects. Not a fan of what they did with her.
Gonna be honest the series made me want to read the novels more so i&#39;m sure many others will follow the same route and as a result once season 2 happens netflix will likely have to start paying more attention to the source materials as like with GoT folks arent gonna let them get away with to many big changes without explanations.
It was soo bad.
My first experience with this universe was the show but it has inspired me to explore the books and games.  I completely understand your negative reaction even though I enjoyed the show quite a bit.  I&#39;ve had your reaction to other properties I&#39;ve invested in deeply and have often wished for greater fidelity to the source material when those properties get adapted.  The one thing you said that led me to believe you misunderstood something about the show was your comment about Fringilla.  Whether true in the lore or not, Nilfgaard is viewed as a cultural backwater by the mages most of whom seem like Northerners expressing what seems to be a cultural prejudice.  The choice kingdoms for the mage graduates at their coming-out ball are all Northern kingdoms.  Nilfgaard seems to have a different religion and cultural history which may be the basis for this prejudice.  However, Northern prejudice is simply Northern perception and not empirical truth.  Fringilla, whose uncle is a powerful mage aligned with Stregobor on the show, was earmarked for a Northern king to ensure a cushy future for her and a place where she would be most useful.  Yennefer stole that position from her at the ball because she dazzled the king with her beauty and boldness to ensure she wasn&#39;t relegated to Nilfgaard as planned.  She believed her Nilfgaardian assignment was a punishment due to her elven heritage being exposed by Istredd; the Northern kingdom of her birth to which she aspired to serve was one that traded heavily with elf-hating Cintra making her posting there potentially problematic.  Even though Yennefer got what she wanted at the ball,  Stregobor&#39;s machinations to assign her to Nilfgaard were not meant to punish her as he thought she had the charisma and raw strength to curb the Usurper&#39;s imperial ambitions.   Fringilla being sent to Nilfgaard as a result of being outmaneuvered by Yenn at the ball actually thwarted Stregobor&#39;s intent since he felt she lacked the power of personality to rein in the Usurper.  His fears were validated as Nilfgaard&#39;s rulers initiated an aggressive expansionist policy on the Continent which Fringilla was incapable of tempering and appears to have given her full allegiance.  She seems to have become a true believer in the Nilfgaardian way and bolsters Cahir&#39;s ego but it is Cahir who is the instigator on the show.  Whether this is at variance with future developments in the saga and games I have no way of knowing.
I kinda enjoyed it to be honest,<br>I liked Henry Cavill&#39;s performance<br>I unashamedly really liked Joey Batey&#39;s performance, as for the inconsistencies, i&#39;ve just tried to take them with a pinch of salt and not taken them too seriously,<br> I suppose I just kinda narcissisticly reasoned with myself that the avarage Netflix viewer wouldn&#39;t be able to understand or appreciate the story the way veterans of the franchise would, and I&#39;m willling to admit that maybe it&#39;s a bit of a c*nt mentality to have, but at the end of the day it&#39;s a show on netflix,<br>So I was kinda expecting them to make differences to try and appeal to newer audiences and let&#39;s be honest, I&#39;m pretty sure most of us was expecting it to turn out far worse then it is
For all this commentary, George came at it all from only two sources...the books and the games.  This ignores one additional source entirely...the Polish &quot;Hexxer&quot; series, which the Netflix series follows to a notable degree...as THAT show was, putting it mildly, pretty terrible but the Netflix version cleans up greatly.  Not even mentioning it represents one hell of a case of dropping the ball.
You spent 40% of the videos runtime either apologizing for your opinion or preparing people for the shock that your opinion might be different.
You mean Dan-dill-ein.
I loved this show. Now I‚Äôm halfway through The Last Wish and I‚Äôd like to look into the games. I‚Äôm not much of a gamer so that‚Äôs a big leap. If the show is this bad compared to the books, I have a lot of awesomeness in front of me!
Wouldnt it be so boring if they followed the books straight ahead? Thought it was great. Think they will reveal the Vilgefortz and Ehmyr/Duny plot in season 2. Books cant be copied to the screen without shortening stuff, cutting stuff out etc.
i think just making a straight adaptation of the books would&#39;ve been redundant and boring. while i agree about certain changes being pointless, a lot of them i didn&#39;t mind at all.
NITPICK VIDEO!! You must make one.
U haven‚Äôt read the lord of the rings, wow
But in turn, that‚Äôs the point. The show wouldn‚Äôt survive if it didn‚Äôt go the way it went, it created a larger pull around Gerald and Yen, while making ‚Äúthe big bad nilfgardians‚Äù. It sells. Personally, I went in the opposite way, I watched the show first. And my first thought was ‚Äúokay this is amazing.. There‚Äôs books about this?‚Äù And then went on to read the books, and play the games. And while I do heavily enjoy the world the books created, I understand why the show is going where it‚Äôs going. It needs to walk before it can run, and it‚Äôs done walking. I believe in the next season now it‚Äôs got it audience, it‚Äôll definitely get back on track.
This whole video is just complaining about how the show isn‚Äôt 100% accurate with the lore, seriously do u expect everything to be completely the same
I didn‚Äôt know anything about The Witcher until Netflix. So I think it‚Äôs great! But I respect your opinion.
Because how could they have filled showtime and kept NEW fans interested with only Geralt and Ciri. They needed Yens story to have a main character, a secondary character, and a vague love interest. You DO sound nit picky. You cant be mad when a show director deviates from the books, because if they DID go by the book, the what the fuck is the point??? The storys already been told. The changes have to be welcomed.
I disagree with a few things and agree with some. The things they ADDED that werent in the books, ie Yen&#39;s story, is good. They needed a 3rd main character, and they needed to CREATE a story to do that. The things they straight up CHANGED from the books, like Nilfgaard, i hated.
The entire Yennefer subplot felt like it was only there to build suspense and to show boobs. That‚Äôs what it felt like for me anyway.
I don‚Äôt mean to nitpick but I was surprised when I watched it that they race-swapped fringilla as geralt says they she looked similar to yennefer I the books
Even though I really liked the show,  it&#39;s good to see a negative review from someone who is very well informed, unlike from someone who&#39;s only seen one episode and knows nothing about the books and games
Well, they just fkd up the entire plot of the show. They could try to fix some things in future seasons, but i believe it will only get worse.
I agree with withcher george. i think the series needs more work, preparation and research to stay true to the witcher series
tl;dw - if you&#39;re a superfan of the books and will be upset by any and all changes in an adaptation, you probably won&#39;t like it.
Witcher: The netflix meme<br>Geralt, the only straigth White male rolemodel is ridiculed and hardly has focus on him. <br>Empowered Indian women are the heart and center of Slavic based fantasy. <br>Almost every character but Gerald black/brownwashed.
I played the games, and know a small bit about the books. But I thought it felt off and the continuity was all over the place. But I still managed to like it, but there are too many depictions of the same story...
Mark Hamill For Vesemir
Honestly if your just going to come out of the gate apologizing then you just opened yourself to getting bullied man I like you but you just got to give zero f**k if your going to give your opinion then go for it do not care what people think if people dont like you then okay move on
Best parts of the show: Scenes involving Jaskier and Geralt , Monster fights and sword fights.<br>Worst parts of the show: Triss ain&#39;t a redhead and looks wrinkly. Actress portraying Fringilla had a lousy acting. Nilfgaard scrotum armor.
Personally i never read the book or play the game, and for me the show was very puzzeling. I am a big fan of fantasy and did look forward to see  The Witcher, but didn&#39;t like it a lot, i don&#39;t hate it. I will wait to see season 2. And for Lord of the Ring... That were great movies, but i read the book first and had real difficuty with the adaptation, and if you don&#39;t have time to read, there are very good audio book. BTW i just buy the first audio book of the Witcher and i will listen it this week, a 12 hours story.
We&#39;re all entitled to our own opinion, and that&#39;s okay.
The real tragedy is not just that the show made changes to the story/characters, but that all the changes made for inferior storytelling.
Your initial comments were enough to make me love you forever.<br><br>Show sucks.
Man you are nice and i respect your thing and dedication to the lore but you said it Yourself  its just because you loved the books that you dont recommend the show My problem is   i know the books and read them and i just loved the games most of all <br>But i don&#39;t compare between show and book<br>Its just not how you rate an original tv series adaptation  It must have a different taste to my point of view<br>In my opinion at least    <br>AND PLEASE READ LOTR BECAUSE IT IS JUST GOOD MAN
I completely understand your opion, but I like this show personally. I know it&#39;s inaccurate, but I really enjoyed the show as it&#39;s own entity rather then a complete remake of the books story.
It&#39;s fantastic as a normal fantasy show. But as a description of the Withcer universe? it sucks
I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with your assessment but the show was super enjoyable for me and as adaptions go, they did honor the books pretty well. 100% agree that they should have followed the books Dryad plot-line loosely to have Geralt meet first, without realizing it was Ciri then become separated only to meet again after he gains faith in destiny.
I completely agree with everything you said and I give you props for watching the whole thing; I could only get an episode and a half in before I couldn&#39;t stomach anymore. I have read each book like 4 times and played all 3 games but it&#39;s been a while , so I went to look up some reviews to see if maybe I had things wrong. All I saw were people saying they were HUGE witcher fans and how true it was to the story and how everything was so perfect, and I knew there was absolutely no way. Then I found this video and I&#39;m glad to see I&#39;m not crazy hahaha. Amazing review and I look forward to seeing more of your channel.
In the end the show was loved and approved of by the author of the original books. He has even said he looks forward to the future seasons. So they&#39;re doing something right.
The show described itself perfectly in Geralts &quot;its like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling&quot; line
In the end it&#39;s just another film adaptation, a version that doesn&#39;t change the original story in the books. Even if hype makes it look enormous right now.
I don&#39;t see it as a &quot;pointless point&quot; to say that the games weren&#39;t canon to the books and the show can be treated the same way. Half your criticisms were about filling in backstories that the books never did and while not talking about things that should happen (but still can in future seasons). That&#39;s exactly the same gripe. Problems with actually changed details due to retelling don&#39;t justify having problems with completely new information that could fit the canon. It&#39;s quite ridiculous to expect a show to be carbon copy content of the books, and it seems like your nitpicky video would list everything that wasn&#39;t identical.<br><br>That said, I agree that some of the more fundamental changes the show is making to the witcher universe is bad, worst offender I think is how magic works. But overall I think the show is a great addition to the universe and that it&#39;s a good adaptation to television.<br><br>Last thing I wanted to reply about was Cahir vs Vilgefortz -- since Vilgefortz is playing both sides (confirmed in the show too, since he smashed in his ally&#39;s head after regaining consciousness), my theory is that he was sandbagging the fight and trying to lose convincingly. I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t come to this conclusion too, but I think it&#39;s because you&#39;re too busy looking for faults that you didn&#39;t realize this.
But hey atleast the song is good haha
I seen only the first three episodes so far and I like it. Like you said, a good fantasy show. Have not read the books yet but I definetley will. I&#39;m eager to learn more about the characters and world I like so much from the games.
I like it. I know the show has inaccuracies but I see it as their own take... like the games
Dont feel like its been recognised enough but the only signs geralt uses is aard and axii like wtf
Overall Review: It didn&#39;t happen in the books
&gt;Nilgaardian armor<br>&gt;The actress they chose for Fringilla<br>&gt;and Yennefer<br>&gt;The medallion<br>&gt;Henry&#39;s eyes not being cat eyes<br>And those are some of the ones I didn&#39;t like
You&#39;re way too defensive. Even as I scroll down to leave this note you&#39;ve left another pinned comment on &quot;Don&#39;t be upset!&quot; Imagine if game reviewers apologized 5 times throughout a review. Just say you didn&#39;t like it, why, and that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m sure a majority of people here are looking for perspective on a true Witcher fan&#39;s prerogative, not a pat on the back for liking a TV series.
Bro<br><br>I&#39;m not hating u but I got to point out something<br><br>The books are a universe,the games r a universe and the series is a universe
I loved the show it was my introduction to the world. I then tried to read the books and surprisingly I didn‚Äôt like them. According to people on twitter I was told the books are better in polish or french? Love the lore videos though
I&#39;ve never read the book and just came from the games, I thought this show was pretty weak. The writing feels on par with the later GOT seasons. I really don&#39;t see why people praise the show so much.
<a href=""https://youtu.be/CcpmD5J8xOk?t=384"">https://youtu.be/CcpmD5J8xOk?t=384</a> Sir i believe you owe a trebuchet , the superior siege weaponry ,an apology
I think the good part of this series is that it is getting me into the Witcher so it&#39;s got that for it.
I&#39;d like to follow your request to watch the whole video before I judge your opinion, but it&#39;s just impossible. I&#39;m 10 minutes in and all the criticism is &quot;this wasn&#39;t in the books/this is inaccurate&quot;. The point of an adaptation is not a one-to-one retelling of holy canon. I agree that they portrayed Nilfgaard as a bit too villainous, but it&#39;s also not true that they&#39;re just a kingdom like any other. Dandelion specifically addresses this in the books when Geralt suggests it&#39;s just an army like any other - they&#39;re not just another invading army, they are bent on world domination and they will kill anyone standing in their way. Cintran nobility committed suicide in the books as well, and not because of some weird pride but because they would be tortured to death. Nilfgaard&#39;s fanaticism is played up but it&#39;s not made out of whole cloth. Emhyr is styled as the White Flame because of Ithlinne&#39;s prophecy, and they view fulfilling it as a mission of ultimate importance, so they&#39;ll stop at nothing to do it. The series decided to show-don&#39;t-tell this determination. Nilfgaard is not doing terrible things because they are evil, they are doing terrible things because they believe they are serving a greater good.<br><br>The games turned the White Frost into a transdimensional magic force, while it was an ice age in the books. Does this make the games a bad adaptation? I don&#39;t think so. Ciri&#39;s importance becomes rather trivial to the story if her only role is having descendants who will help humanity live through the an ice age several millennia hence. Having her literally stop it made a better story for her.
They didn&#39;t make this show for documentary purposes, they stayed fairly true to the source material, yes there are some major things that are wrong, especially brokilon forest, but stuff like nilfgaards backstory being a bit off ...you were completely interpreting that by yourself..also the show never implied that Yen would have fucked up anything. That&#39;s all your own imagination there .<br><br>You are certainly giving some good points, but I think the issue here is not the shows flaws , but actually your high expectations of the show , and I dont blame you, you&#39;re very invested in the lore, but it does feel to me like you went in far too deep with your criticism. I do feel similar about the inconsistencies but, I&#39;m very happy with how the show turned out because I had very, very low expectation to begin with, and those expectations where proven very wrong by some key elements in the show that were really really good.<br><br><br>Btw my LOTR copy has been sitting next to my bed for the past few months too haha.
1 up side though ; because of the show i have watched every episode so far from your witcher3 playthrough.
I agree w everything you said.<br>Huge ideas and depth was prolly that ‚Äútoo much‚Äù was left out.<br><br>If they went for it.. this show would already be better than got at its peak.<br><br>In the story of the striga... yay foltest is not this fat inbred but was very clever as you had to be to stay kind in the northern realms. <br>Foltest seemed the most balanced of the kings in the north. He wanted to speak to geralt alone. Geralt would not force that situation. Yea there is a lot wrong as foltest is the heart of Temeria and when he fell ‚Äúnot in books‚Äù nilfgard was ready for full invasion. Foltest was the only monarch that could bring the north together. As demavend and Henslet we‚Äôre constantly fighting like the Middle East and redania has a hot tempered angry lil boy who hates sorcerers bc of Phillips herself.<br><br>The fight w the striga was fine but they left out the animalistic fight for survival it became. As it was for the girl as she didn‚Äôt have the strength or speed of the striga she still was a beast and bit through his neck.<br>That‚Äôs fine, they show that.<br>What they don‚Äôt show is geralt falling into a fight or flight state and biting the shit out of a little girl. Which absolutely happens <br>Enough to where the medicine man that patched him asked him why he tried to bite the girl to death????<br><br>This really is the heart of the realism the books give that they need to go for to be the artists and do this fantastic work justice
I personally like the show, books, and the games and I think it‚Äôs completely fine for you or anyone else to dislike the show, it‚Äôs just a show after all. For me though I just think it‚Äôs an alternate universe where different things happened compared to the books and I just enjoy the show for what it is. The show isn‚Äôt perfect in any sense of the word and one of the things that bothered me about the show was the costume design for Nilfgard. They‚Äôre supposed to be the army of black and gold, not the army of black ball sacks.
This video is on point, great in detail review, not a big fan of Netflix&#39;s adaptation.
Kahir was such a lovely guy in the books! I cried when read the 7th book, when they fought in the castle. Geralt&#39;s &quot;ganza&quot; is the best thing (for me), i loved the moments with them (Regis is so nice, Kagir so warm-hearted, Milva so cool and my fav Jaskier so funny, Angulema is a mood). Anyway, i so so so hope they won&#39;t screw that up. At least that (but it will be a long time till they get there). And I understand your indignation too well. Good job on the video, would like to see more picky review :)<br>Thank you
I watched season 1 without reading the books but I have played Witcher 3. Watching this video just made me want to read the books.
I enjoy Henry cavil being Geralt, other than that this whole show confuses me
Thanks for your honest review.
Thank you so much for addressing all this. True from beginning to start except I even felt that they messed up Gerald&#39;s and Dandelion&#39;s relationship (so far I only read &#39;&#39;Last Wish&#39;&#39; and &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;). In the books Gerald cares for him, maybe his best friend much more.¬†<br>Well the one thing that this show accomplished is to divide the fanbase and make money. So sad...
I did not like it because of the forced diversity.<br><br>I really liked the queen though.
I do mostly agree with this. The writing was bad, some of what was there shouldn&#39;t have been there. For instance Duni (Or however you spell his name) I think they call Ciri&#39;s father is suppose to be Emyr. Which is weird how they&#39;re like &quot;Yeah the future emperor of Niflgaard that goes to conquer the rest of the North almost, dies on a boat.&quot; But, I genuinely enjoyed it in spite of this. But, I love the way you see it, and I enjoy the way you do call out some of the shows mistakes. I honestly look forward to seeing you review other seasons of the show. I haven&#39;t read the books since I was really young, but, I do remember distinct differences in lore between the books, and games. But, the books, and games follow a different story. So, it&#39;s more acceptable compared to Netflix rewriting the story. But, I enjoyed it nonetheless. I can see why other people would dislike it, but, I liked it. I hope it turns people onto playing the games, and reading the books.
I enjoyed it for the most part and am curious to see what they will do with it, but that&#39;s not to say that it didn&#39;t have its flaws with cringe moments or lack luster writing here and there. As someone whose only played the three games (but will probably start on the books soon) I can&#39;t comment on major changes they made. I do think the stuff with Yen in Aretuza was some of the weaker parts of it. Not meccesarily a bad thing they chose to build on her back story, just definitely could have been presented better.
Make the nitpicking video üëÄ
In my opinion, the most egregious character change Netflix has done was the one they made to Queen Calanthe. In the books she is wise. In the Netflix aDaPtAtIon she&#39;s loud, violent, insulting - absolutely opposite to what she&#39;s described in the books. The feminist author of the series wanted to make her look bad-ass, but instead turned her into a bumbling parody. There&#39;s a phrase that feminists like to throw around... What was it? Can&#39;t put my finger on it. Oh, yeah - toxic masculinity. If someone asked me for an example of toxic masculinity, I&#39;d point at Netflix Queen Calanthe. It&#39;s funny how the feminists lack self-awareness to notice that.
I have the utmost respect for your opinion! You are my most trusted source for Witcher lore and I so very much enjoy your videos. I can fully understand why you didn&#39;t enjoy the show based on your intimate knowledge of the source material. I have never read the books so for me it was an enjoyable show. I feel like it has lots of room for improvement and my hope is that it gets better with each season.
Well done.  As someone who did very much enjoy the show, I appreciated hearing a different pov on it.  To me, the show reminded me of everything I adore about the universe, the Slavic roots, the general dark tone, and Geralt in general.  It also introduced my wife to the universe, and may have inspired her to start reading the books.  For her, all the backstory stuff is crucial, because it explains /why/ a lot of the characters are who they are
Cahir is  basically  Riance at this  point.
I loved the show having only played though most of the Witcher 3. The show and games made me want to read the books to understand more about the story. I do agree with you about changes in the show that I have noticed so far having read most of the Last Wish there is just so many changes and so much left out.
Sapkowski apparently had a hand in the writing of the tv show. Agree, the books are much better but i found this entertaining for a hour by hour episode.
The sad truth is, the writers injected their identity politics into something only a very small minority cares about. The result, they ruined the show for the nerds who know the lore very well. And for a lot of people who reject the current political correctness madness. Therefore only people who don¬¥t know the lore good enough can enjoy the series. What is still the majority it seems.
Thank you WitcherGeogre I am glad that I am not alone in liking the show. It alright, but it&#39;s not what I was hoping a Witcher show would be. The armor,Dryads and the over villifing of Niffigarrd really pulled me out of the show among other things. It was a slog for me to watch it. I don&#39;t expect a 1 for 1 adaptation. I know that is impossible. I just thought they would follow the books more then this. I will give season two a chance. If I still don&#39;t like them at least I still have the books and games.
I think that the Netflix show has problems, but still is adaptation from a game and book story which means it could be much worse, and I am happy how it is. I think it has many problems, but still is interesting and it will attract new Witcher fans, that was the idea.
&quot;Learn to let of everything you fear to lose.&quot; - Yoda. <br><br>This is written/spoken like many of the bitter Star Wars fans I have seen over the last few years (although you were much more polite than most of them). Of course they were going to change things. You can either enjoy it and go along for the ride or get caught up in your personal complaints and nitpicks.
As a person who really liked the show, I think you were much meaner to yourself than it. All of your criticisms were well founded and clear! It&#39;s all taste, and the points you made weren&#39;t nearly as sensationalist as some other reviews. I really enjoyed your review of it.<br><br>And I appreciate your opening. You should never be ashamed of being a kind, considerate person. &lt;3
I get that the series isn&#39;t 100% alike with the books and some changes were made but the games also made changes which nobody bats an eye to. <br><br><br>the point is the changes aren&#39;t world breaking. any witcher fan whether from the books or the games will recognize the series for what it is: an adaptation and a pretty good one at that.<br><br><br>this could have been far worse. has everyone forgotten about Death Note?
I personally love the show. I&#39;ve started reading the books too. I just finished The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. I know that the show and books are very different, but that&#39;s only to be expected with a screen adaptation. I like to consider the events in screen adaptations to be happening in an alternate universe to the universe the events of the books take place in.
As a person who previously haven&#39;t played the games or read the book, I went in knowing lots would likely be changed. While many of the changes may have been poor, when considering the source material, I would argue a couple work.<br><br>Namely, I do think it was a good idea to establish Yen before she met Geralt. Having it so we followed some of her journey before the paths converged was a decent idea. I&#39;m not saying HOW they did it was exceptionally good or brilliant, but conceptually, I liked the idea. I&#39;m not sure if they had anything to previously establish Yen before the events of the last wish, but to my understanding, there was not.<br><br>As well, I would argue the show will at least draw more interest to the books and games, for an audience that may never have seen or read them before.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to fault you for not being able to see this as an AU version of witcher, as I can understand the changes are jarring. And you did mention plenty to like about the series.<br><br>I do have one question though:, was there anything changes made to the show you felt they did better then the games or books? Even if not in execution, any concepts you felt were good ideas? If not, don&#39;t worry.
I get being mad about it, I had the same feeling with shadowhunters, but at the same time, it is an adaptation.. shadowhunters is a great show when you go into it blind for example.. but that&#39;s just my opinion
What I really didnt understand when it came to the show is why they mixed the timelines up so much that unless you knew the witcher already or somehow was taking notes on each and every little comment characters made off hand, you would be incredibly confused. The way they mixed the timelines made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Also, the show made yennefer so annoying and hateful. I cant stand her in the show.
i loved the show probably because ive only played the third game and read the world of the witcher. i honestly want you to point out more differences so i can learn more, as you said youve been absorbed into the witcher for 2 years. the way i see it the more lore you let me know about just makes me love the story more and inspires me to read the books and play the other games....juss me doe
üåü <b>Yarpin, and the dwarves was the best.</b>
I enjoyed the show despite the fact it wasn&#39;t terribly well written (as a show, I can&#39;t judge for the books).
Everyone knows the reason they &quot;had to&quot; add all the extra stuff with Yenn and Ciri is Netflix&#39;s problem with not having women in lead rolls at all times, they couldn&#39;t have Yenn not be a lead character that&#39;s story isn&#39;t tied to Geralt&#39;s. It&#39;s the same reason they chose the actresses for Yenn, Triss, and Fringilla despite fans getting upset. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad show but it definitely feels like Netflix is just trying to capitalize on the popularity of GoT and that&#39;s style of show, they just choose a super popular title to &quot;adapt&quot;
this show was complete trash im sorry but from the casting choices except Geralt (henry cavil) to the crappy costumes / cg  and  the dialogue was bad. the story was all over the place and doesnt even follow the books at all. and that cintra vs nilfgard  battle was horrendous. triss looks horrible, too  much sjw trash and they just made this show super rushed and just overall bad. the first fight scene looked bad tbh. ciri is annoying and she doesnt look the part and unlike the books and the game she doesnt seem cool and spunky.
Stick to your guns. We all have our own opinions an it‚Äôs ok
man if you like the show, definitely try to read/listen The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny. These are two books that are collection of short stories which they based upon the 1st season. Spoiler : The show did a disservice to these books. The showrunner missed the point of the source material.
A lot of what you&#39;re saying is just speculation on what you think the author was implying or the details of historical events that are mentioned. The author worked with the showrunners on this.. so bvb I think he would know how things went down even if he didn&#39;t mention them in the books
Just imagine how they&#39;d adapt O Dimm... if they get that far...
As someone who had very low expectations before seeing it, I was very positively surprised.<br>Cavill is great as Geralt, I liked the actresses playing Ciri and Yennefer.<br><br>I don&#39;t really mind the changes that they&#39;ve made (I&#39;ve read the books), the TV series is their own thing just like the games.<br>There are still things that bugs me, some miscastings, some plot points/characters, etc. But all in all, I really enjoyed the show.
The biggest problem of this series is the &quot;show-runner&quot; and her writer team, don&#39;t understand what netflix saw in lauren, the writings in the show was one of the worst and weakest in a tv series.
I love the show but havent read the books or played the games. I value your opinion and thank you for sharing it honestly. Fine work good sir!
Here&#39;s a drinking game: drink a shot every time someone says &quot;destiny&quot;. <br>You won&#39;t live through episode 5.
I have had a really hard time finding someone who agrees with me that the show is bad and it feels great to finally see someone talking about it
im not super well versed in the lore but do you know the witcher that died in the show he seemed to be from the school of the wolf and hes barely brought up and it seemed Geralt didn&#39;t seem to know him
Witcher is like some modern age drama having vintage fashion sense and poor performance by most of the actors... Please don&#39;t watch it if you are  more into acting, story telling, music and less into meaningless action show off
You all shouldn&#39;t ignore the first Witcher game, if you don&#39;t like reading books at least play the first game it will make a lot of things clearer.
I liked the show, but I appreciate hearing your views and I have liked and subscribed.  I wondered if you planned to review episodes, as I think that would be interesting to watch. You could do an in depth analysis of what is different and might find the occasional thing that they changed that you approve of.
@witchergeorge didn&#39;t the author fucking hate the games and work with the writers on the show?
Part of the reason Ciri is older is because child labor laws make filming with kids a major pain in the ass. Same reason Game of Thrones aged up the Stark kids for the show.
hey even tho i do not agree on the fact that you don&#39;t like the series i think you went on really polite about your opinion. i can see why but these reasons didn&#39;t bother me personally only the nilfgaard bit tbf. but let&#39;s just be united by the love for the witcher!
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=13m00s"">13:00</a> exactly
Triss got burnt by a massive magic explosion thing that tore several people to pieces and blinded yen. Took huge amounts of magic to heal it and was the cause for her character arc. Oh wait just a torch. <br>Bad her magic relies more on nature then the one from the supposed druid.<br>Nilfgaard is the evil empire of evil. LotR orks were sold out, but they had equally ugly stuff.<br>I don&#39;t care about ciri. She&#39;s annoying and boring.<br>Vilgefort beat geralt in combat and yen in magic. Only together they stood a chance, but cahir has plot I guess<br>Rest is OK to good. I was on the fence on this, but the last episode  made me mad. So much BS.<br>I hate it now, I doesn&#39;t have the feel of tho books nor the games :-(<br>If u like it and get into witcher because of it, don&#39;t let me stop you, tho!
Hi! :) Even though I don&#39;t share your overall opinion of the show, I liked your video and I can understand many of your criticisms towards the show. I&#39;ve read the books myself and I noticed most of the inconsistencies you pointed out while I was going through the show. While some of the inconsistencies hurted me a bit (just to mention a couple of them the storyline of the dryads and the role and background of Fringilla), I believe that most changes that they did with respect to the books were not among the most important things to show in this first season. For example I liked the addition of Yennefer backstory, because even if it was not discussed in the books and there was no need for it, it&#39;s not something harmful for the character or the main plot. They did modify many things with respect to the books, that&#39;s true, but if you want to have the story exactly as it is in the books then you should stick to them, no adaptation will ever be as good as the source material. I would probably have preferred to see many more things represented as they were described in the books as well, but the show is, in general, not a bad result in my opinion. It could have gone way much worse, expecially considering that the first two books are constituded by many different episodes quite disjointed from one another and I think that organizing a &quot;continuous&quot; plot out of them was not an easy task. Sapkowski&#39;s way of writing and describing characters, facts or stories is really not easy to represent on a tv series. For example it is way easier to represent something like the books of game of thrones, where the narration is totally different and probably more suitable for a tv series.<br>Yes, the show is not not perfect, I think most fans of the books will agree on that. Still I think that the overall result was not something to be discarded and I quite liked it. We will see how the things that they did differently will develope in the future :) I think that most of the inconsistencies are coming from the format of the first two books, probably when we will move to the next seasons where the books get a more continuous storyline the series will also get better :)<br>I am sorry that appearently there are a lot of people unable to understand other points of view :/ even if we have different opinions I really liked your video and the accuracy of your thoughts :)
I think you misunderstood the Nilfgard/Frigilla/Yen thing.<br><br>My thought was that the sorcerer&#39;s wanted it to remain a small nation. Fringilla didn&#39;t have the umph to stand up and she was to easily led. Where as Yen would stand up to whoever was in charge and prevent their expansion.
I really think cahir is more of a fanatic for ehmyr. He doesn&#39;t seem like he wants to go the more evil way a lot of times until fragila, or however you spell it, manipulates his loyalty to ehmyr
Your opinion is completely valid, but Yennefer is my personal favorite character in the show.
I dont disagree with all the changes but as someone who has played the games and read the books I find the changes made to the story still makes the books worth reading the show is fine but while the things end the same way as the books but the way they get to the end of the stories is fine with me I like that the books are still a different story than the show
I know someone will call me racist but the random like minorities kinda started to get to me like YES HAVE THEM THERE but please can they all come from this kingdom instead of like this hyper mixed castle guard and shit like give them some minor seperation this is a time period where discrimination is rampant in the witcher universe
Never read the books or play the games, I don&#39;t know what to feel about this show. I guess I expected too much from the hype all over the internet. I just wish they introduced the realm better instead shoving too much information, places, characters which will be soon forgotten. <br><br>The chemistry between the characters were... man, none of them ring the bell for me. Even that Jaskier guy, kinda cringey. Leave alone Geralt and Yenn chemistry, I-<br><br>Poor character developments but hey it&#39;s only season 1. There&#39;ll be another 6 and I really hope the show will get better. Glad some people like it tho.
I&#39;ve read the books AND played the games AND watched the show.  I like them all.  They&#39;re all different media.  <br><br>Soooooo, yeah, I think you&#39;re being a bit nitpicky (except the magic part, I don&#39;t see why they did the exchange thing)... this was changed less than Game of Thrones, and the writing of ASOIAF is way better than these books.  Seeing Sodden and Yennefer&#39;s story is neat though, even if those were fabricated from tiny little nuggets in the books.  The books can play with pacing and details in a way that the show can&#39;t, because it has to be interesting from the beginning.<br><br>But it&#39;s fine to disagree.
Once again Geralt tried to make the swallow potion but ended up making a proteine cocktail.
As someone who read the books and played the games I‚Äôd say that I liked the show and don‚Äôt mind the changes they made. It still tells an comprehensive story with interesting characters and ideas like where does fate end and personal choice begin in a world filled with magic and spells.<br><br>I also completely disagree when say that the show was implying Fringilla was the reason Nilfgard became what it is. I didn‚Äôt get that vibe at all. If anything it made it very clear that Emyr (referred to only as the White Flame in the show) was the one galvanizing Nilfgard. On that same note, they weren‚Äôt implying that Yen would have fucked up if she got assigned to Nilfgard. They were implying that she would have steered them away from warmongering and conquest.
Having only been able to read the Last Wish and Blood of Elves so far, I can&#39;t speak to most of these critiques but I do think it&#39;s worth noting that Marilka is an actual character in the short story &quot;The Witcher&quot;, if only a very minor one. She&#39;s the daughter of the alderman, and I&#39;d surmise she was expanded in order to speed up the story from Geralt entering town to meeting Stregobor, but that only really disappointed me due to losing the bar scene in the beginning. Just pointing that out
I mean, what do you expect ? Summarize a whole book in a 45min episode? I feel they did the whole show as a tale, as if they wanted to tell you a tale or legend where all leads to the main scene.
Using the word &quot;incorrect&quot; to describe screen portrayed events is incorrect. Things happened as they had to for an intriguing fantasy show narrative.
It&#39;s not even a good standard fantasy show. Even if you totally ignore it as an adaptation of the first two books- which the showrunner, producers, and director have stated they are, but even if we ignore that and treat it like its own fantasy show, it fails to follow its own guide-lines. What we&#39;re witnessing is the death of cinematic progression. People are no longer making cinema to test the limits of what can be expressed and told through a camera&#39;s lens, they&#39;re merely interested in passive entertainment franchises for the purpose of selling products on Amazon. this is why I disagree with your assertion that casual fans, or people who haven&#39;t read the books, can sit down and enjoy the show. We&#39;ve had a full generation now of incredible television that has surpassed all previous television from the 20th century- as audiences, we should be punishing creators who write and direct poor television, and reward those who push boundaries and faithfully adapt older mediums to Television. Your complaints about the show are shallow, surface-level fandom reactionary &quot;B-But this isn&#39;t my books!&quot; instead of disassembling this terrible show <b>first</b> as a television show, <b>then</b> as an adaptation.
Oh finally a good review!<br>I mean, the dialogues were just lazy writing and sincerely, shit. I know that people are biased because they love the story and the character, but it was badly written and full of cliches. Just watch it again and analyze the scenes a bit. I was rolling my eyes constantly and couldn&#39;t enjoy the story at all.<br>Plus, I was hoping Dandelion would die, literally.<br>The only good fight scene was in the first episode. And he basically killed 2 monsters
I liked it. Fringilla being changed was annoying but for the most part it gave the feeling of the witcher. I think fans criticize it hard because they are expecting it to be just like the books and games.
the one gripe i truly have with this show is the common trope of hollywood making everything look dim and saturated. and the hero wears all black armor or black is the most common thing the hero can wear, its almost like they are trying to be  game of thrones with its color and tone alone, and to me the witcher always seemed much more colorfull despite the games. and even the games does a good job at presenting ambiance through tone, which is why i dont understand why they had to go the GoT route and saturate everything.
Now I see why english speaking people like this show the way better than we do in Russia. Most of them had never read any of the books and have no idea what the characters should be like. What the entire story should be like! It&#39;s upsetting to see how the story, which potentially could be an entertaining journey of main characters, looking for each other amongst great events happening around, like freaking war! But instead we&#39;ve got a story of bullying, stupid jokes and lame battles. Why on the earth they shoved so many story lines in 8 episodes like they&#39;re making 1 and a half hour movies where they should somehow show everything possible about the Witcher&#39;s universe?! For what sake?! You&#39;ve got TV series, you can make it as long as you need to tell this amazing story! There&#39;re so many things to show!! But instead they made a mixture of everything they heard of from the books and games, all the characters - and splashed it in the face of the audience!  I can&#39;t imagine what they&#39;re gonna do in the next season. They&#39;ve distorted and misinterpreted every character, every storyline. They&#39;d rather write spin off about Yennifer, than call this crap &quot;The Witcher&quot;!!
Finally an honest review! I can see how u r trying to be polite and not to hurt fanboys feelings too much :) From a disclaimer it seems that it‚Äôs so hard to tell your own opinion nowadays in western countries
As the old saying goes it would be a dull world if we all thought the same WG.  As far as the books are concerned I&#39;ve only reached as far as the Str--a story which came earlier in the books than the TV show if the audio book I was listening to was correct. I enjoyed the show even if it was &quot;fantasy lite&quot; but then I&#39;m not immersed in the lore. I haven&#39;t played the games.  I have watched a few &quot;lore&quot; videos lately and when the &quot;wild hunt&quot; (which references Eastern European legend I believe) was mentioned I thought of the old cowboy song &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; - Wikipedia showed that I wasn&#39;t the only one who had made that connection.
Something being shown in the series, but not being described - only referred to - in the books is not an actual problem. And you kind of are nitpicking with some of your gripes :). Who cares THAT much if Borch - a one-episode character - is old?<br><br>That being said, I actually agree with you - as an old Wicher fan, the many changes they&#39;ve made pretty much block me from enjoying the show. I also resent the fact the showrunners have decided to pretend the games don&#39;t exist, instead of borrowing some good stuff from them.<br><br>They should have stuck with way the books present the story, focusing only on Geralt in the first season, with perhaps some of Yennefer&#39;s backstory. Cirilla&#39;s story would have been perfectly presented with the betrothal feast in Cintra, her adventure in Brokylon with Geralt and the flashbacks Geralt has in the &quot;Something more&quot; story. Instead, they chose to show me some girl running from someone and trying to find someone else already in episode one - if I didn&#39;t already know what&#39;s going on, I couldn&#39;t have cared less. Which is how much I cared for Calanthe&#39;s death, which could have been much more impactful if the character hadn&#39;t only had a total of 10 min screen time before dying.<br><br>One more thing I don&#39;t get are the supposed episode time constraints. Who said each episode has to be exactly 1 h? Can&#39;t they split a story into two 40 min episodes? And make the next one <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=1m10s"">1:10</a> h long? It&#39;s a streaming service, it&#39;s not like they have to conform to TV airing frames or anything ...<br>Phew, long comment, but I had to get it out :)!
You simly cannot say there is anything good without bad side effect.<br>The entire series is abbomination and it&#39;s horrible, wrong and disrespectful piece of wake garbage. It&#39;s like if you say: &quot;Hell, Human centipede, the movie, has a good camera and acting...&quot; Well okay, might be, but it&#39;s still just piece of totally awful shit, that has nothing to offer to normal viewer... Actually this has nothing to offer other than horrible satisfaction to a twisted mind. <br>If you say there is something possitive, you simply do a favour for future bullshits like this, even worse maybe. Because already too many people just accepted that we get shit movies with some aspects that are actually good but in general it&#39;s mostly garbage. So now there is alot of people just defending the series because &quot;It&#39;s not as bad&quot; and &quot;We had worse series&quot;. NO, NO, NO! This is all wrong. Of course there are some possitives but it&#39;s totally destroeyd by the amount of wake bullshit, anti-racist and multicultural propaganda as well as horrible cast, costumes and all that just joint into one single pile of mess. <br>There is literally nothing possitive about it. You don&#39;t say: &quot;Oh this apple is 90% spoiled... but well, the 10% is good, so it&#39;s not as bad.&quot; What every normal person do is to get rid of this bad apple and get a better one with 100% of it&#39;s inside intact by any nasty thing.<br><br>I know you don&#39;t want to look bad but you already do in the eys of all fanatical fans and woke retards so no point.<br><br>BTW. I just played games and read some Wiki info but I hate it with all my heart.
I just read the golden dragon chapter, (after watching the show). I was really struck by how much better it is in the books. Also Yennefer and Geralt‚Äôs relationship seems a lot more toxic in that chapter. Also why did they choose to do what they did with Eyck? I get they killed him so they didn‚Äôt have to include the dragon duel, but they also made him seem like a complete buffoon. Yes he‚Äôs a zealot and a bit over the top honorable, but I feel like they did him dirty
Appreciate your informed opinion of the show, as someone who is more experienced with the lore<br><br>Have mixed feelings and am still confused about the show in general, considering a second viewing of the season, but I‚Äôm a lot more likely to just buy&amp;play The Witcher 3 game and watch lore-based videos that draw from the books
This video is basically my opinion
In my opinion, you aren&#39;t doing a review of the 1st season. You are simply doing a book/game comparison to the show. Don&#39;t dislike the video, but I think your title is a little misleading. The thoughts point, sure. But not a review, just a comparison
As someone who really wants to like it, I was really dissapointed with it as well. Other then the things you mentioned, the cinematography was so very bad sometimes I ended up laughing out loud.
You should make a super nitpicky video. I do enjoy the show, but I wanna know what they completely changed.
Your review is on point, you have a great knowledge of this whole witcher universe and i loved your voice and accent. Great video
The storytelling is pretty bad.
I loved it. It was Good and my mom loved it and she hates fantasy
you&#39;re being too nice about it. theres not a lot to like about this series. all the changes end up being illogical or boring or both. they had a chance to show slavic mythology and culture before it got reformed but instead of getting something with flavour like established Greek or Norse mythology we got this dull western fantasy. yennefer in the show is just a selfish greedy cow and everyone licks her shoes and she gets the most screen time. I&#39;m not interested in the show and I cant give a flying fk about any of those characters. I recommend watching &quot;Vikings&quot; or &quot;the boys&quot;. that&#39;s much better television.
Look look look....you have you&#39;re right to dislike it, yada yada, but you are being over the top hating on Yennefer&#39;s backstory. If she&#39;d just shown up hot and powerful in the whole Gine thing, I wouldn&#39;t give a fuck about who she is. But seeing her struggle, seeing her past and where she came from was compelling, made me have interest and investment in the character. So hearing you say its all unnecessary and such, all I can think of is are you wanting to make the show worse? You want a character to have a LESS fleshed out backstory? You may know a lot about Witcher lore, much more then I do, but you clearly don&#39;t know much about good storytelling...Who cares that her past was never shown in the books, to me thats a mistake on the books part, not a mistake on the show for giving her a backstory.
Thank you for this. Not knowing anything about the books (or the games to a lesser extent) is pretty much the only way I could see myself enjoying the show. That said, I think Henry did a decent job portraying Geralt, same goes for Dandelion/Jaskier.<br>(Also, I can&#39;t believe that as a long time Witcher fan, I&#39;ve just stumbled upon this channel^^).
Let netflix just change name of the show on &quot;Witches&quot; and change Geralt name on Boby, Dandelion on Cactus or so and all gonna be good, coz there is almost nothing form Witcher in that series except names so that would be honest and there would be nothing to pick on.
As someone who&#39;s never played the games or read the books, I quite enjoyed the series and it has piqued my curiosity in the original stories. I&#39;m even wanting to buy the games now I&#39;ve finished the series.<br><br>It&#39;s absolutely understandable that this series would wind you up because you&#39;re obviously something of an expert on the original stories and the games. However, you&#39;ll have to accept that for a lot of the general public, this will be their first taste of the witcher and they will take the story presented to them as &#39;the story&#39;. Most people won&#39;t much care if it differs from the books if they enjoy the series. I think you just have to accept this as an alternative interpretation which doesn&#39;t overwrite the things you enjoyed in the books and the games.
Nope, the &quot;bad adaptation&quot; argument is bs
As others have said, I really don&#39;t think the damage control is needed. The title literally says &quot;review and thoughts.&quot; If someone agrees or disagrees with you, all the more power to whoever. I quite honestly do have to thank you for your review. I&#39;ve just watched the show and haven&#39;t read the books and no nothing about the games. I now have every intention of exploring this universe further, largely thanks to this review. Not every book translates well into a show either. Books inherently have far more room to really shape the characters and universe because they&#39;re not necessarily bound by time constraints, network restrictions etc. I felt fairly confused for the first half of the show, largely because I was left to figure out that a lot of it was set in the past. Particularly in GoT, I always thought of it as a, &quot;what would happened if these characters did this instead of that?&quot; kinda show. Particularly later on, there&#39;s a lot of differences between the shows/books. Even if I hadn&#39;t seen this review, the show already made up my mind that I wanted to read the books. If a show is good enough to do that, then why not?
I&#39;ll be honest... I&#39;m someone who walked into the show having never read the books and knew of the games but never played them and really loved the show. <br><br>I also loved hearing your opinion about the show cause it&#39;s kind of inspired me to make an effort to seek out the books and games and give them a try.
Finally, someone who notices these problems.<br>Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t mind changes if they didn&#39;t seem to be focused on removing moral shades of grey and dumming it down for casual audience.<br><br>For example the dragon in book teaches about chivalry. The dragon in the show is more like &quot;I&#39;m a dragon, lets fight!&quot;<br>Or of course the Nilfgard which was made absurdly evil to, idn., make sure that eweryone gets that they&#39;re antagonists?
To paraphrase Geralt himself, &quot;The Witcher is The Witcher.  Greater, lesser middling.  It makes no difference.  If I&#39;m to choose between them, then I&#39;d rather not choose at all.&quot;<br><br>The great thing about The Witcher is that they&#39;ve all impressed me and made me feel.  And given all the work you&#39;ve done regarding the games and books, they clearly have you too.  That&#39;s what matters in the end, and whatever the differences in our dislikes we&#39;ll always have Geralt.
I don&#39;t know much about the original story but you speak as if changes themselves were bad. There are the good and the bad in what is changed, and not all are strictly bad.
I appreciate the honest review and agree with several of your criticisms. However I do feel like instead of analysing how the show adapts and expands on the stories, you tend to focus on how it ‚Äúincorrectly‚Äù or ‚Äúinaccurately‚Äù reflects the portrayal in the books. At the end of the day the showrunner has the creative license to let her vision come through. For example, I enjoyed the detailed backstory for Yen, I think it gives her character a lot more depth that is not necessarily explained in the books. Yes at times the story can be convoluted and not fleshed our but I appreciate how they are trying to adapt the timelines whilst trying to introduce the vast Witcher universe. I enjoyed the show on the whole, and look forward to the ongoing development of the Witcher world, as well as the creative changes made by the showrunner.
I never read the books, and I can imagine it‚Äôs hard to adjust/come round to the changes that have been made and where it varies from the books, especially if you really enjoyed the books. (Which, because books force you too create all the visuals from you‚Äôre imagination, it‚Äôs always more special to you as you have to imagine your ideal characters/settings/landscapes and overall art direction) so a TV/film adaptation is never going to capture the magic and overall vibe to the extent would come close to your initial experience. But you do have to remember that, for those reasons, it will never live up to your version, and that adaptations have to make creative decisions for story telling and structure, again because you can not express the full extent of the story and descriptions from a book and fit it in to a show/film.
George: &quot;I d-&quot;<br>Me: &quot;So you&#39;ve chosen death.&quot; <br>All jokes aside I respect your opinion my man.
I disagree with a lot of what you said, most small changes are irrelevant and some changes we don&#39;t know where they will go like nature of Nilfgaard or rules of magic. Vilgefortz lost deliberately because Yennefer was watching him and I don&#39;t think its a bad thing we get to see lots of things that were not shown in books like Sodden or Yen past. Show has real issues but to me it seems you don&#39;t like its not 100% adaptation and that&#39;s impossible. To me important stuff that were bad have a lot to do with script like not highlighting the point of lesser evil and why Geralt went back to stop Renfri. Or not telling what was the last wish. Those are important bad things and not some random peasant not being 100% lore accurate. Overall I think its a good adaptation for now, considering constraints of reality like...budget, Netflix not knowing how the show will be received so they cramped in as much as possible not expecting season 2 as a given. The core is strong, main 3 characters are good and if they don&#39;t stray drastically from the source (with all changes for now they did not) its faithful to the spirit of books and games and that&#39;s the most important thing.
As a person who has never read or played anything about these stories, the show was a great introduction, although it sounds like the show has a lot of inaccuracies, I am super excited to read the books and play the games now
Its like they had one who knew of the books in the team and the others just &quot;yeyeye, we&#39;ll put that in somewhat. By the way, wouldnt it be cool to make the Nilfgaardians&#39; armor look like shit?&quot;
Cavill is a great Witcher! The show is great.
To be honest nah I&#39;ve never read the books and ive only played witcher 2 and 3, but the show led me to look up witcher lore, which led me to your channel, and has gotten me to play more of the games and wanna read the books. Yeah the show isnt the most accurate but fuck the show is so cool. I adore it. Im super excited for season 2.
As someone who had not read the books, I liked the show enough to pick up the short stories and first book. So, there are some positives of the show in that it brings some to the books.
George ...I too am not a fan of this show....I figured you will probably get lots of negative comments and maybe you might appreciate some support and honesty....and by the way...thanks for your lore channel...you&#39;re content is great...very in depth and professionally presented..keep up the good work...now...the show...probably better mention the glaring elephants in the room....I do like Henry Cavill as Geralt...slot...however...one sword..really...where is his silver sword for monster slaying...talk about a glaring mistake...and no Witcher sign use I saw at all....these are integral to witcher&#39;s...inexcusable....don&#39;t like the actresses chosen for Cori...doesn&#39;t look like Cori at all...don&#39;t like Yennifer...doesn&#39;t look like Yennifer or act as she would at all..especially don&#39;t like actress playing Triss...I mean hello...doesn&#39;t remotely look or act like the Triss I know from the game...magic is weak and weird...magic users far too weak and impotent compared to the game at least...haven&#39;t read the books...yeah it&#39;s all wrong in so many ways...so I&#39;m with you George...not a fan either and I watched it all...in fact at many points I fell asleep...boring...needs more action..monster fighting..etc...too much pointless backstory drama that&#39;s not even correct...just boring to me....so I support your opinion as well...keep up the good work dude..a fan...Sterling
Your review was on point!!! I agree with almost everything!  I made a point to read all the books before the show and I was extremely disappointed with the changes they made.
You should make a series of videos describing the differences between books and the series
They should have you come in and help the writers lol. Maybe as an analyst or something
This chanel is quickly becoming one of my favourite chanels and i cant really put my finger onto why that is idk if its your voice, the oveall stories, the fact your name is WitcherGeorge or a mix of all of them but im really liking it so far
Not a fan of the show either. Still can&#39;t stand Yennifer, did they actually make Triss a &#39;person of color&#39;? She is Fair skinned, probably a Ginger (take that out huh RACISTS). <br>Black people in Czech history? (no blacks in ANY Czech or Eastern Europe).<br>As much as Netflix tries to remain &#39;anti racist&quot;, boy they really f that up.
Dude your disclaimer is so openly honest and heartwarming. Thanks man. I‚Äôm a way bigger fan now after just the beginning ü§ìüíö
I loved the show, but before it ever came out i was of the opinion that it was pretty dumb to base the show on the books instead of adapting from the game, because this would appeal to a much smaller fanbase. But as you said it had the happy accident of actually appealing to the games audience and the casual audience by, for one, being well made, but two it seems like it&#39;s an original concept to anyone unfamiliar with the books. To people who have read the books i assumed they would be upset for many of the reasons you listed, so originally my assumption was correct. Not complaining though, happy it&#39;s good at least on its own.
I absolutely agree with you, to be honest i was not surprised by how bad it was because i knew it since i&#39;ve watched the first trailer and thought it&#39;s gonna be terrible, as a huge fan of the books i thought the writing in this show was an absolute trash, the casting and the acting was bad and cringe worthy, even Henry Cavill i thought was really annoying with the way he did his voice, i mean at some point i expected him to say &quot;I&#39;m Batman of Rivia&quot; and his acting in general is mediocre to play such a deep character like Geralt, and don&#39;t even get me starting on the actress who plays Yennefer ahhh... i didn&#39;t feel any of Yennefer&#39;s charisma in her portrayal of the character at all, there are so many crap in this show like the way they changed some characters and turning Nilfgaard into some Cult empire and removing the essential part where Geralt and Ciri met and bonded for the first time, etc.... <br>I could go on forever, so yeah the show was A Pile Of SHIT  -_-
I did like it. Just sayin
i loved the show and im now super excited to play the games :) as someone new to the series i love to hear from the long time fans even if they dont agree with me, and i definitely value your word. i wish ppl stop squishing criticism with negative griping. id be interested in knowing how you would ideally see the show!
Mate just have your opinion, you don‚Äôt like something. Fantastic. No need for the 300 apologies. Anyone that gets offended by someone disliking something they like needs to get a grip
I get what you&#39;re saying, and I agree with him. But jesus you sound snobbish at times.
The title for this video should be - &quot; The Witcher - Netflix, did you even read the books?&quot; <br>Ma dude, I understand, you are passionate, and your channel shows it. Good work.
this was an interesting video. i&#39;m someone who knew nothing about the witcher before this tv show, and i loved this show! but i understand why you, as someone who knows all the details from the books and games, would find it hard to not nit pick. I&#39;m the same when it comes to Harry Potter, as I&#39;m a die hard fan of the books, and I find it hard not to complain about some of the choices the directors and writers made about those movies. I don&#39;t think you need to apologize this much about not liking the show. And it was interesting for me to learn about all the differences between the different versions of the Witcher :)
Stop apologizing and just have your opinion. People are cunts, and the assholes that would hate you for disliking this show won&#39;t stop being assholes just because you were conciliatory.
The reason they said that Yen would make nifgard worse isn‚Äôt because of of her being incompetent, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt like her and are being mean to her.....not sure how someone misses that clear sign of bullying üòÇ
I kind don‚Äôt care about how yen was in the show because I hate her in the books and game as well, so it‚Äôs just more of the same to me.
I couldn&#39;t make it past Episode 3... god it&#39;s a self-indulgent snoozefest. Fuck this show, it seems to be written by the biggest blow hards ever and does nothing at all to add to the world. That&#39;s from somebody that rates Witcher 3 as one of, if not my favourite games of all time. It&#39;s a bland cookie cutter Downton abbey game of thrones shitfest. Zzzzz
I appreciate your gentle approach. Everyone has a right to like or dislike something and you expressed your opinion with great respect for others. I did enjoy the Netflix series, but I could see how you might have an issue with it. I know there have been so many times I&#39;ve fallen in love with a book series only to have tv or movies ruin it for me. I&#39;m actually reading the witcher series now so who knows I may change my mind about the show. It&#39;s actually been your videos that inspired me to read them. Thanks for your amazing content! I honestly just love how you explore all the lore behind the witcher series. I&#39;m huge fan of folklore and mythology.
I know that GOT ended up devolving into a raging dumpster fire in the final season, but I think it did a much better job, in its first season, of giving us a condensed but painstakingly accurate portrayal of the source material, both in the spirit of the thing and in most character and plot points. I wish the makers of Witcher would trust their own source material more, instead of trying to out-clever it all the time. I worry that if they&#39;re this loose with it now, it&#39;ll only diverge further from the books as time goes on.
It&#39;s the pain of loving something that speaks to you and wanting other people to have the opportunity to have their own experience with the things that were special. Then, a reinterpretation comes out and misses out on some, if not most of those special things. If the other people like it, there will always be that little frustrated voice lamenting that they didn&#39;t get to experience the intended representation of those things that were special. If they didn&#39;t enjoy the reinterpretation, they may decry the something as a whole without going to the intended representation of those things that were special. It doesn&#39;t just have to be with regard to books; this could be anything that you love that has special things that speak to you. Unless that person has had an opportunity to have experienced those things that were special, and form their own opinion, they will not understand why you become so impassioned about such things. <br><br>The Witcher books brought me to tears, they brought me delighted laughs, they brought me larger than life stories about destiny, morality, change, and perspective, told through very &quot;human&quot; characters. Therefore, I am upset about the show on account of my above explanation.
I can understand and forgive where they weren&#39;t trying to lift everything word for word from the books or games. What I can&#39;t understand or forgive is that goddamn nilfguardian armor...
Good video, stay honest and keep it up.
I couldn&#39;t agree more with your opinion. there was just so many problems with the show. I&#39;ll start off by saying Henry Cavill is a pretty solid Geralt. You can definitely tell the acter brings a level of passion to the character. Aside from a few awesome fight scenes with Geralt the rest of the show pretty much Falls flat. Terrible casting decisions coupled with a &quot;woke sjw agenda&quot; and just terrible writing. I swear they cannot convey exposition in a engaging way. Most episodes I just felt extremely bored. The timelines jump all over the place and we just didn&#39;t get enough of Geralt in the show. Not to mention the terrible design of the black necrotic nilfgaardian scrotum armor. Here&#39;s hoping season 2 learns from its mistakes, and maybe borrows the writers from True Detective season 1 and give us a more stellar Witcher experience than what we&#39;ve been given.
Hi there ! I didn&#39;t read the boocks nor play witcher 1 or 2. My love for the white wolf comes only from the wild hunt so there&#39;s thing I don&#39;t really understand. So in the show, Yennefer trade her uterus to become pretty yet, she act like she got tricked to do so, putting blame on the witch school. Can someone explain to me what did really happened cause that part sound really really stupid to me...
I really don‚Äôt think they wanted to be that accurate to the books as someone who never read the books or played the games the show was amazing maybe that‚Äôs the group they were catering to cuz they had to do Yennefers backstory for the audience to care about her. They did a great job with all the characters and their connections with each other.
I disagree with you on Yen. I think they did too much, but I think you need see it from new watcher&#39;s view where they wouldn&#39;t get her without some introduction. I think they could have cut the elf boy, half of Yen&#39;s story, brokilon etc and generally borrowed more from the books and less filler.
I really disliked the whole Nilfgaard backstory and characters in the show. They boiled down a nuanced and grey civilisation and characters into daft tropes. Fringilla, Cahir and Vilgefortz were my least favourite parts. The doppler story, Brokilon etc just wound me up.
I realy disliked it. Some of the parts are enjoyable but as a higr book and games fan i can&#39;t love it. The best part is everybody attacks you if say something bad about this show
I completely agree with you. Don&#39;t apologise for you opinion, for someone who has read the books and played tha games this show was shit from beginning to end. Making Yennefer a young girl of 23 years old?! Triss without red hair?! And Geralt and Ciri running into each others arms in the end when they haven&#39;t even met yet? There were a ton of things that pissed me off but the Yennefer story was by far the worst part. I hate that they chose a girl over a woman for this role and that they told her backstory, showing her weak and sad and crazy. She&#39;s crazy powerful and dangerous in the books and game and not someone tp pity like they showed her in the series.
Hissritch &amp; co are abso-fuckin-lute hacks.
Regret giving this douche a view.
Even only had read the first book I noticed differences and the show felt like it rushed some parts and skipped the one Geralt story I liked. I understand your pov.
you need to make a video being brutal about all the problems in the show!
I love the games...  but even Henry sucks in this show
As someone who played the games and started to read the books after watching the series (I&#39;m still on the first one), I think I have to agree to what you said about the made up parts. I feel like they wanted to introduce the 3 as main characters from the start and felt an &quot;origins&quot; story was needed for all of them. Since I haven&#39;t caught up with Yen and Ciri in the books yet, I can&#39;t say anything else.<br><br>Regarding Geralt, I think Henry did a fine job in portraying Game Geralt, but criticism is more than welcome if you bring Book Geralt into the scene. But more than his own fault, I think the producer&#39;s idea is more to blame. They made Geralt the &quot;hmm&quot; machine of the games and stripped him of a lot of dialogue that could express what were Geralt&#39;s opinions in the situations he&#39;s been put into in this first book/season of the show. For me the Lesser Evil tale was ruined by not showing how much of a joke he thought the curse was, what were his opinions on mages like Stregobor, what Renfri said about the Ultimatum and butchering the whole market if needed. In the show, it just seems like he meddles in a moral conflict just by his own will, which isn&#39;t all true.
The show just feels like it&#39;s trying to fill the void left by game of thrones. It&#39;s trying to be more like game of thrones than trying to entice people with the atmosphere and world of the witcher.
Finally someone who says what he thinks without sucking up.
I love Henry Cavill as Geralt, but I agree with all your other points.
I watched this show and then deiced to read the books because of it . At his moment i have read the last wish and and have nearly finished swords of destiny (currently on the swords of destiny short story ) i am enjoying the books and the more i read the clearer these differences are. I understand your problems with this show and the more i more i understand and agree with you. Keep up the good work.:)
i loved the show
I feel like this show is a good for thoes who know nothing about the witcher series (books or games) and they just want a brief look on what&#39;s the world and characters are like. For me personally, this show was great cause i have only played with the witcher 3 and i was like &quot;if i like the show i will pick the books up&quot; and i will. The fact that people are saying that this is not as good as the book are only makes me excited for them even more.
I played the games and watched the show, I liked it.
I appreciate your honest opinion, great video
Yeah, the Netflix version should be seen as a stand-along show on its own.<br>But in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=10m53s"">10:53</a> &#39;unnecessary&#39; changes aren&#39;t something that we as an audience can say. We don&#39;t know what was happening behind the scene and production phase. If you want to criticize &#39;unnecessary&#39; changes, you better show some solid evidence from their production team. Like, the penis black armor is pretty unnecessary because the fucking activists shout out for that.
Why Fran black now?
@WitcherGeorge i recommend you try The Witcher audio books i have just finished the last book and they are all fantastic.
I respect your opinions on this and I think they were expressed well and without vitriol.  I like the show, but I have never read the books or played the games.  The show has led me to looking into the Witcher more though.  It led me to buying the books, likely buying Witcher 3, and has brought me to subscribing to channels like this which I enjoy.<br><br>BTW - if you (or anyone else happens to see this) - I watched the Vampire videos you did.  Do the books explain why only Higher Vampires can kill Higher Vampires?  Is it magic, the world they&#39;re from, etc.?
I really hate how the &#39;&#39;golden dragon&#39;&#39; was just an ugly wyvern with 0 personality... And i really felt like Vilgefortz was stronger by what people said about him, i hope he ends up using fire magic in the future.
adapted from the video games, based on the books.... inspired from true historical events
So as a less opinionated view of your review, you really take a lot of your opinion from little differences and a lot of story differences or how the storytelling is done in the books. But this is kind of a problem because this is less of a review and more you comparing the books and series, with little to no reference to the games that the show takes much more from and nitpicking character developments. Saying an adaptation should be 100% faithful to a novel series. Side points: I agree about the pacing, Yennefer having pointless scenes, and some bad dialogue but otherwise I think you&#39;re reading pretty heavily into the show just not including all the novel story or changing things.<br>ps. you said Ciri&#39;s aging is wrong, the series is going to include the story of the Witcher 3, Ciri will be an adult so her age in season 1(which doesn&#39;t match up to the novel timeline so I don&#39;t know why you included it) doesn&#39;t matter<br>pps. I think you said &quot;in the books&quot;, or &quot;books/novels&quot; over 50 times
You should do a review on Alzur¬¥s Legacy Witcher fan film.
Well, I&#39;ve got other complain, Netflix in his first season doesn&#39;t show how Gerald became a witcher and for people who don&#39;t know his story... for them Gerald is/will be only the assassin that can be hired for a few coins. Oh and the last scene from episode 8 was ridiculous, &quot;I don&#39;t know you, you don&#39;t know me but we hug each other like father-daughter reunion&quot;.
Thank you for making this review. Initially while I was watching the first 3 episodes I thought that despite the Aretuza scenes not being in the books , it might make for a nice change , but it ended up hogging up way too much screen time that would&#39;ve been used for proper character development and extending the other scenes to make them look more natural. I agree with everything that you said about their changes , they&#39;re redundant and take away from the narrative without adding something authentic , like the games did.
What writers were thinking? <br>Probably how to please every one by casting every race in the plane .... Feminism... Love drama... Where can I address the issue of gay... Representing American society problem in the TV series and other stupid stuff <br>It doesn&#39;t seem like not a single writer had read the novel before being    appointed by Netflix and In couple of months they read the story while half of their brains thinking stuffs like ( well here we can show feminism...here a little bit of family drama... Killing a baby will make the show gruesome it&#39;s dark fantasy afterall...I don&#39;t know what exactly is a kikimora but sounds cool thought it will be on a cool looking fight scene ...a little boobs here and there and bang a good fantasy show)
After watching a couple of negative reviews...(just to check if I was the only one that hated the TV series because every one is praising the Witcher ) after watching your opinion I even hate that TV series more... Now there&#39;s like 30 things that I hate about the Witcher and I can point every one of them
I have got a lot of problem with the Witcher as well...it was painful to watch and I only watched it because I am a Witcher fan and I followed the progress of the series since the announcement..
&quot;TOSS A COIN TOO YOUR WITCHER&quot; !! &quot;OH VALLEY OF PLENTY&quot; hows my singing guys?
I agree with your totally @witchergeorge even I didn‚Äôt like the The Netflix Witcher that much , cause of the same reasons as you mentioned in your video , many of the aforementioned stuff was just unnecessary and didn‚Äôt mean any sense at all . Especially the Vilgofortz stuff and Cahir. People who are not aware with the Witcher lores properly must have liked it just because they found an alternative drama fantasy to the Game of Thrones .
I do think that it is a good thing that the games, books and series are different in many ways. If they were all the same I personally wouldn&#39;t have the incentive to read the books now. In conclusion I think for the witcher as a whole it&#39;s a good thing because more and more people are coming to enjoy this story. <br><br><br>But I also understand that it might be dissapointing that the TV-Show changed so much but that happened to GoT too. Many stories that were significant in the books were vastly changed or even left out - to name one: Lady Stoneheart. Let&#39;s just hope they don&#39;t mess it up like they did at the end of GoT.
The Nilfgaard armour is the thing that made me angriest (closely followed by fringilla/triss casting). Honestly, whoever made the decision to arm Nilfgaard in scrotums should seriously be fired. Allowing someone with that level of stupidity in your development for a show is just ridiculous. Seriously, fire them.
Have the makers of the show seen this? It will be nice if they do.
I dont really like the show but i dont really hate on it . I noticed some little things where i thought how in the hell like in episode 2 ciri   makes her hair dirty with dirt so You dont really see shes blond then when she finds a camp with her People and walks in she is blond again  its a Little thing but when je rub mud in youre hair it for sure isnt going suddenly not going to be there anymore  i have to say geralt armor kind off looks like the armor when je start witcher 3 New game  the nilfgard armor in the show is horrible the show isnt really bad its Just not for me
The show is mediocre at best. A pity since the source material is good enough for a very interesting tv adaptation, in more capable hands.
I don&#39;t know how they will change Cahir and Vigefortz characters. Whole Sodden, &quot;evil&quot; Nilfgaard and even magic &quot;system&quot; is completly different also. I hope next season will be more focused - same as novel and screenwriters will have it easier to tranfer moments from books.
Please  c&#39;mon no  version of any series will match what you immagine will be good or proper this is a series that planned to reach plenty of people, and they made that clear this is base of on the books not a copy cat and cleary it was Not cuztomize for you, THIS WAS NOT MADE ONLY FOR YOU, you talk like ir this series is bad only because does not have what you wanted to see, do you hear what you say  after you said it,  no cr√≠tic is objective but you go way further, you need to go outside  and have a life
Of all the reviews people have posted about this show, yours is the only one I want to watch.
Glad you didn&#39;t like the show, looking forward to not watching a season 2 review from you.
From what I heard from the leaks before the show it is supposed to be based on the video games more heavily than the books
Cavill is the perfect casting choice for Geralt. On the rest of the show, I pretty much share your view. The writers are just bad as are many of the casting choices.
I for one found the channel from watching the show i enjoyed it but didnt play the games or read the books so i can totally see where you&#39;re coming from and why you dislike it
I see a lot of criticism about the differences in the show from the books but not the differences in the games from the books.
Here we go again, &quot;in the books&quot; üòâ
Why do we have the words spa, hotel, and shindig (to name a few) on the screenplay? The etymology of these words doesn&#39;t match the time setting of the story. [&quot;Spa&quot; - early 17th century, &quot;Hotel&quot; - late 17th century, &quot;Shindig&quot; - mid 19th century...] I know it&#39;s a fantasy story and understand artistic license in the shooting of the film, but the screenplay, parts of it, is a letdown. The CGI could be better.
The world is getting so offended by everything that a person can&#39;t state an opinion without making a 5-minute disclaimer about how his opinion might not match yours, lol.
loved the game and lore, i dont like the show<br><br>a lot of what you said are the same things i felt off about it as well.
Lmfao death note
They said it was an adaptation not anything more.
I respect your opinion my guy. The show got me replaying the games and wanting to read the books. The Witcher is such an interesting and different fantasy story. I also highly recommend that if you read The Lord of The Rings, read The Silmarilion first. Rough read but totally worth it.
As someone who only played the Witcher 3 and hasn‚Äôt read any of the books, this show was really enjoyable
I accidentally started on the fourth episode first time watching it and I thought it was better for yennefer as a character with mystery
Too much apologisms in the video. A disclaimer in the beginning would be more than enough.
Finally a review that&#39;s honest and not afraid to critique the show.
I totally disliked Yennifer in the show. I found her to be a whiny, selfish bitch. Beautiful, yes, but so unlikable. Henry Cavil and his bard were the best part of the show for me. Overall it was only okay.
please, do the nitpick video.<br>the uteres scene.<br>MY GOD. the uterus scene.<br><br><br><br><br>(need i say it&#39;s one of those things they changed and has no equivalent in the books nowhere?)
Show was boring and overall trash. Yennefer was annoying as hell and plot was all over the place. SJW bullshit ruins yet another franchise.
im fine with changes...generally. But in the witcher changes makes no sense and are not easier to film or produce compared to source material...so why change something established and loved is beyond me...esspecially if it doesent make it any easier to produce,, i liked the show tough...maybe im biased but i really liked it...hopefully the wierd stories told are more true to source now that everyone is tigether in the timeline
I believe the witch cannon balls were a hyperbolic rendering of the idea that armies used magic users as fodder through those gory battles. It‚Äôs understood many were compelled or coerced to participate and many consequently perished.
man... just THANK you for this :D i&#39;m so confused about the fact that so many people (even those who say they read the books and loved them) praise this show so much. claiming to go for the books and then changing so much for no apparent reason... making nilfgaard the generic bad guys -.- all that crap about yens past... i might be a bit nitpicky, sure, but why take this amazing story and turn it to a just &quot;ok&quot; show? this should have been nothing less than mindblowing! all that potential thrown away. and the persons who are responsible for that niflgaardian armour design can just straight up go fuck themselves. or instead of viper eyes, mentioned so often in the books they went for twilight vampire eyes? whyyyyyy, wouldn&#39;t even be that big a difference in creating, but a big difference if you like details to be right :D that kind of crap just throws me off ...<br><br>edit: and especially sodden. wtf was that about. if you don&#39;t have the resources to do it right, why do it at this point? no need to include that battle. nilfgaard as an actual threat, not just some groups of uncoordinated soldiers. i wanted to see some really crazy magic shit, that i couldn&#39;t even imagine, instead they make triss basically a druid and yens endgame is a (huge ass) flamethrower? that whole part was just so much cringe for me, disappointing af...
I view it the same way that I view the Warcraft movie. It&#39;s an Adaptation. It&#39;s its own thing with its own lore. Just enjoy the fact that some form of the story you love is brought to the screen. It&#39;s not a big deal bud. lol
Honestly, I just see the show as being a different retelling of the stories in the books. Shows or movies rarely are better than the books.
To put it simply, the writers/producers of this show decided to go down the cringey, one-dimensional fantasy/SJW road, while relying on the hoards of die-hard fantasy fans (i.e the low hanging fruit) to save their bottom line. Those types of &#39;fans&#39; aren&#39;t really fans at all... their consumption of these fantasy-esque shows/games are simply serving as a kind of identity marker for them, rather than as a genuine artistic or intellectual interest. <br><br>On the other hand, real fans like WitcherGeorge can see past the fandom hype and actually make a fair and measured assessment of the show and the ways in which it was a lame, surface-based shell of what it could have been due to the bloated story-line, cheesy expositional dialogue and lack of immersion.
I really appreciate the opening disclaimer.<br> It was long enough for me to make up my mind on whether or not I wanted to watch the rest of the video. I elected not to, but I&#39;ve left a like.
A lot of commentary in other youtube videos have really left a bad taste in my mouth because of how angry and inflammatory they were, but I really appreciate how you built a really compelling and reasonable argument that the show I really quite liked does not hold up for fans of the books (that I admittedly have not read). It means a lot that you&#39;ve made something so reasonable and that you&#39;ve been so empathetic about it.
Why Fringila Vigo is black, why the rat boy is black, are they black in the books? Also Triss is awful in the show, i don&#39;t like Netflix the Bitcher half a bit.
I understand your points about the series, but I also wonder. If the show would be exactly like the books (which I read myself years ago) I think in my point of view it would be pretty boring. At least now things are happening that you don&#39;t expect. Tho yes some small details like the story with Borch could&#39;ve been better
The writers are intersectional feminists, more commonly known as SJWs. That is why the lore is messed up. If you look at this adaption through a neo-marxist lense then you can see why they made certain decisions. <br><br>Don&#39;t expect the integrity of the world of Andrzej Sapkowski to remain in tact with such people at the helm. You&#39;ll only get subversion from narcissists that must see themselves and their ideology reflected in everything.<br><br>This culture war is something awful.
I was expecting absolute dog shit but was pleasantly surprised enough that I&#39;ll consider watching season two. <br><br>That Nilfgaardian armor is unforgivable however.
Nice video. I&#39;m one of the people who actually enjoyed the series in spite of reading the books and having almost 400 hours of the games but... You&#39;re absolutely right on what is wrong, I truly hated the whole Fringilla, Cahir and Nilfgaard arc in the series.<br>It is so out of character and for no reason at all, it seems like they needed villains to be shown right from the start so they could have a sort of climax... Well, damn. Hope they get it better next season.
The things you said changed are the things I hated in the show lol also I hated the writing it was cringe a lot of times! but I loved the actors and the base stories are awesome now I want to read the books
I think you went on too much about saying sorry to appease imaginary fans who you think would hate your opinon. People become because your the lore Guy and want your opinon. I just recently found the chanel and I like to know the diferences between book adaptaions (I watch the Don alot). I have only read the last wish so I came out feeling like too many things were rushed and alot of characters and designs and other stuff changed for the sake of being changed. Maybe It have to do with how the author and CD Projekt Red contentiousness over the years which now seemed to have settled. You said all the negatives which are vaild and a few postives but not many but didnt explain many of the diferences (probably would have been mind-bugglying). So It feels really imbalanced. Doesnt really feel critical and it just feels emotional. You cant please everyone dude and its not your job to. I didnt mind the series but I see the flaws. They can defintely be imporved, I think the people making it have heart for It. You should defintely voice you thoughts but try to be as &quot;Contrutively Critcal&quot; as possible. Otherwise people will feel you&#39;re being naggy which is what you want to avoid right? But thats just me, dont be down, cheer up and a happy 2020
My impression of the show wasn&#39;t that Nilfgaard was a weak backwater country, just that the Northerners think that way.  The way the Nilfgaard prince was treated in ep. 4 was very disrespectful, so it doesn&#39;t seem surprising their prowess would be heavily underestimated.
I loved it
Great video man, I have to admit I&#39;m a fan of the books and the games but I loved the show.  There were some parts that I didn&#39;t like as much but overall I really liked it.    <br><br>I can see were your coming from though and even though I don&#39;t share your opinion I did think you stated your reasons for disliking it pretty well, and I can apreciate where your coming from.  <br><br>Keep up the great work am looking forward to another year of lore content.
I haven&#39;t read the books or played the game, but I did watch the show. And I understand how someone like you who lives and breathes Witcher would be disappointed. It probably feels like they disrespected the story. However, you clearly understand that the games are an &quot;alternate universe&quot;, perhaps it&#39;s best to think of the show like that? I loved the show and I&#39;m glad that they&#39;re making another season.
Yeah I only watched it because I played the game, and I enjoyed it. But because I enjoyed it I went and ordered the books so I can be well versed of its history. So far I I only gotten through one book and I spot the differences, so I‚Äôm treating them both as separate mediums like game of thrones. But if the second season diverge you much then I might have to come to your side. But yeah you are entitled to your opinion and no one should cyber bully you for your opinion. What if the roles were reversed, not many try to see the other side, or try to respect people for their opinions; but they want their opinions respected. Odd?
When a show is based on books, and 3 games were also released based on the books its never going to be perfect. GoT was also not perfect. But I think they did a great job I really enjoyed all 8 episodes.
I liked the show. The time line stuff was terrible
More people watched this show that never even read the books or played the game so to them, show was good.  All these book readers crying that everything wasn&#39;t the same as the books.  Geez. I think the show was amazing.  Book readers need to calm down and sip on some hot chocolate.
I feel like you&#39;re pretty black and white about them changing stuff. If it&#39;s not changed from the books it&#39;s good and if it&#39;s not it&#39;s bad. You&#39;re right that some of the changes were straight up awful and unnecessary, but some add layers to the story that the book did not. I did for example really like the stuff they added about Yennefer&#39;s past, like her thirst for power and desire to control her own destiny, while her past being mysterious in the books didn&#39;t really do a lot for me. It just made her seem either stupid or reckless most of the time, because I didn&#39;t really have a basis for understanding her motivation the way I did in the series. <br><br>But it&#39;s not like you&#39;re not allowed to have you&#39;re opinion, and you shouldn&#39;t have to apologize for it the way you did.
I liked the series,but thought it was a little choppy 8/10. I also don&#39;t know the lore like you would. I get not liking it if I was immersed in the lore. Those changes you stated would annoy me too.
I read the books and played the games multiple times and I feel extactly the same. The show is just as awful as the last seasons of GoT.
@WitcherGeorge<br>I completely understand where you&#39;re coming from, there&#39;s several flaws in the show. I have also read the books and played the games (not to your knowledge however) <br>But I think it&#39;s a great bit of TV and WAY better than say,  the Sword of Truth (and lesser extent, Game of Thrones) series they brought to the screen based on the books<br>Anyway , love the channel, merry xmas &amp; happy new year :)
Love the channel, but I think you‚Äôre too close to the subject material (obviously).<br><br>It‚Äôs an adaptation, not a 1:1 recreation. Things are going to be different.<br><br>It‚Äôs fine to dislike something because you dislike it. It‚Äôs not fine to dislike something because it didn‚Äôt happen or it happened differently... but it was well executed, cool/interesting, and/or advanced the narrative.<br><br>I agree with you entirely Ciri‚Äôs journey to and through the forest was completely pointless.<br><br>The dragon plot was cool, but the CGI was awful.<br><br>Dandelion saying he hadn‚Äôt seen Geralt in years could have been missed if you blinked in the Djinn episode. <br><br>Yennefer and Geralts relationship is rushed and large time periods are missing between single episodes without explanation. <br><br>Other than that, I think it‚Äôs damn good. But those are some large flaws. I‚Äôm looking forward to future seasons and I think they‚Äôre just starting to hit their stride.
I don‚Äôt even know as much as you do about the lore but even I saw what was wrong what was added and changed and am sorely disappointed. I gave up at episode 5. It‚Äôs the same let down I felt with the walking dead series. Too much changed and too much added and it really makes no sense. The scenes and the dialogue are all laid out for you. Why change? Why add?  I only see the reason is to appeal to casuals and misinterpretations
Count how many times he says &quot;in the books&quot;.  So you didn&#39;t like show because it wasn&#39;t exactly like the books. Your entire video comes down to that singular point.  Evey other sentence in your video begins or ends with &quot;in the books&quot;.    I mean I guess that&#39;s a valid reason but not sure it&#39;s a good one because you aren&#39;t judging the show on its own merits. Guess  I am glad I didn&#39;t read the books because then based on your perspective it would be impossible to enjoy the show.
You finished the full season not the full series.
I respect your honesty mate! As your review is the same problem I have with the tv expanse over the books, as I very much do not like the tv show at all.<br><br>I do however very much like this show, and was probably the intended audience for this version, as I didn&#39;t read the books nor played the games at all. So I&#39;m probably not gonna read the books until the show is done.
Hmm.
People in the comment section need to say less
pls bevore you read lord of the rings read the hobbit first.
beeing a hobbit fan, i can 300% understand your point on the show. i enjoyed the show as a show, but , even thoughi didn&#39;t read the books yet, i have some nitpicks and problems with it too. for me it&#39;s a seperate thing you can watch with the books in mind, but not see it as a book adaptation
Give it up for Tissaia DeVries, the goddess who graced our existence with her own ‚ú®
My biggest issue with the show was it seemed like it needed a stronger guiding hand to make it work.<br>In the first three seasons of Game of Thrones, George RR Martin himself was an Executive Producer and made sure they followed the books well enough so that there wouldn&#39;t be as many issues. And we all know what happened when he and the books left the show...<br>It seems like the people running this should consider bringing in some of the writers from Wild Hunt so they can help direct the show.
One of the, if not the best review so far. Good job, you hit all the points. You need to realize that every time you say something you will offend someone, no 2 people are the same nor should we be and everyone has the right to their opinion and if someone disagrees with that opinion then it&#39;s not the end of the world, it&#39;s the most normal thing in the world. If people are hating on you because you expressed your opinion then those people don&#39;t deserve your time, just ignore them, realize that those people don&#39;t think the same way you do and move on with your life and keep making videos. Too many youtubers have lately been expressing themselves that they don&#39;t want to hurt peoples feelings so they&#39;re gonna stop doing what they were doing... my god, stop living then, because even that hurts peoples feelings. There will be lovers and haters and that&#39;s how the world works, you can choose to be guided by it or live your life despite of it.
1. It is fine to mention it is your opinion, but you&#39;re going on far too much in order to &quot;damage control&quot;. I can understand to a certain degree though. 2. I have only played the games, and been interested in the lore to the point of reading wiki stuff and watching Youtube (I&#39;m here after all). 3. Overall I have enjoyed the show so far. I think it is getting the feel of the Witcher and the world they are in, right to a certain point. As you said I don&#39;t feel we needed so much information or time invested in Yennefers background, and the Geralt as a kid as well. I may be threading dangerous waters, but I don&#39;t like the amount diversity of the show. I don&#39;t mind some, but when it feels they have gone out of their way of doing so, it feels and looks out of place, despite the fact that I do think the actors have all been great. It is a bit like having loads of white people in Wakanda or white people and so on. Triss feels miscast to me as she looks older compared to the games. They should also have made the time jumping much more clearer than they have done. Also there should be more focus than Geralt than other cahracters if you ask me. I know they have said it is done to introduce the important characters, but I don&#39;t feel it has been done in the right way. I agree they haven&#39;t presented Nilfgard in the right way either. Also the whole battle scene felt a bit out of place and somewhat underwhelming to me in how they did and presented everything. 4. I really do hope they show the developing father/relationship aspect of Geralt and Ciri in the next season. It is made clear they had one in both the books and games.  5. It never seems like the vast majority of movies or TV series get book adaptations right because books can be much more complex for one, and the way people use their imagination of how things look in a book will always be their own, but I get your criticisms. To me the overall feel and look of the world is important, and I hope season 2 will improve with less fillers that we don&#39;t need.
Exactly my opinion. Glad to know im not the only one ;)
Oh and you&#39;ve said before Yennefer&#39;s story in the netflix show was pointless and wasted time (in another video), Yennefer in the show is my favourite character and for a lot of other people, the actress playing her did such a good job and she drew me in watching the show and i love it. (and yes i have never read the books or played the game)
They are different mediums, it&#39;s a good show and if you don&#39;t like it that&#39;s fine but are you at least happy that the show isn&#39;t total trash? Do you find any enjoyment in it for what it is? It&#39;s really sad to think that you must sit there the whole time crying to yourself that it isn&#39;t perfect or what you wanted, grow up.
Completely agree with this gentleman.
Much of the books happen inside the character&#39;s heads. The additional netflix characters in &quot;guide&quot; roles serve as an effective foil for the audience. I reckon the golden dragon changes were mostly budget related. Otherwise I agree with you.
Lotssssss of sssssssnakessssssssss in thisssssssssss video :P
So wait don‚Äôt Witcher‚Äôs have emotions if he loves yen ?
Have you considered diving into &quot;The Expanse&quot;?  The books are fantastic.  And the show is even better!
Honestly thanks to this video, I&#39;m gonna hold off on watching the other seasons until I read the books.
IM NOT ALONE  , THERE ARE SURVIVORS
How much is the Netflix show in keeping with the storyline in the book series? How much did you guide the show?<br> Sapkowski :<br>Not much, I confess. I strongly believe in the freedom of the artist and his artistic expression. I rarely interfere. And very rarely try to impose my view on another artist.<br>This show just use brand of Witcher and nothing much else , Sapkowski ( and fans ) know this .
those were like 24 minutes and 35 seconds of damage control
Of course the show is different from the books. You keep saying ‚Äúits wrong‚Äù. You keep saying ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù. Nothing is wrong or right, as its an adaptation. Its a different medium. You can‚Äôt tell a book on screen....it just doesn‚Äôt work. Its my understanding that Sapkowski was involved heavily in pre-production of the show. <br><br>You‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôre an authority on Sapkowski‚Äôs source material, and came into this with expectations that were not met. This show was NEVER going to adhere perfectly to the source material. Its BASED on the source material. <br><br>Is Game of Thrones exactly like the books? Is Lord of the Rings exactly like the books? Tough choices have to be made. They have DOZENS of characters to introduce. They have an entire world to teach us about. <br><br>Unnecessary changes? Do you have experience with adapting literature to film? I don‚Äôt. I love the books, but they are their own thing. I love the lore, but its such a massive universe, they can‚Äôt present it all, and they have to make choices. <br><br>I think the show has a TON of potential. I understand that they wanted to present all three main characters in the first season, but it was because of this, that all of the jumping around made it difficult to follow for some. <br><br>IMO, it may have been better to focus on Geralt alone in season one, and just introduce Ciri, and maybe Yennifer towards the end of the season. Too much time spent on Yen and Ciri this season. <br><br>I anticipate the next season to have much better focus, and am looking forward to it.<br><br>Seems like you wanted everything to be the same....it wasn‚Äôt and it irritated you.<br><br>You keep leaning on ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read the books‚Äù, well so has the entire country of Poland.....and the show has had rave reviews from Poland.
I have not read the books,I have not played the games. So, I view this as it should be viewed as a damned good TV show. I&#39;m not some hairy arsed fan boy who feels butt fucked when he watches it. If you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t fucking watch it.<br>As Geralt would say  . . . . FUCK!
Get over it nerd. You have become too attached to the minutia of tiny details no one cares about, now you can‚Äôt even allow yourself to enjoy this perfectly enjoyable interpretation. You talk like this is actual history they have gotten wrong. It‚Äôs all fake and made for entertainment dude...let it go.
After a long time I&#39;m back it&#39;s a long time and still your vids are always good keep on doing what your doing man its actually good content  ... <br>I enjoy it
Unwatchable, ridiculous dialog and acting
I loved it, but I get it. I went through this with aSoIaF adapted to GoT seasons 5-8.<br>The source is always there.
I totally get where you&#39;re comming from and what you are saying but I enjoy seeing stories of Gerald being translated to live action mainly because I have only played the withcer 3 and have not read the books
Being honest is not a bad thing. Don&#39;t feel bad about sharing an accurate and detailed critic on something we all love; we all want to see the best of this series and have the same feelings we got while reading and playing the games.<br><br>I totally agree with you! Having read the books and played the games, I had different expectations on the series, compared to poeple who haven&#39;t been that inmersed within the lore.<br>I think the show is okay, yet terrible with some adaptations and some character&#39;s development. <br>It seems that this series works fine to fulfill the interest that general audience has in fantasy. However, for those who wanted to see a little more accuracy with lore and source material, the show is bluntly disappointing.<br>Honestly, I do not mind having made up stories in the show as long as they don&#39;t change the lore and the stablished lines. e.g. the doppler chase for Ciri was a promising idea. As long as it does not touch the main story it could have worked just fine.<br>Sadly, there were a lot of moments in which I could not ignore the changes and I felt bad for watching a wasted oportunity for future episodes, or even changes that doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br><br>And for those who get really annoyed with your critics, relax! We don&#39;t critize this to make it worse. I guess people like WitcherGeorge would be the last person who would like to see this show fail and be canceled or something. We want to see that people out there experience the amazing world of The witcher, the way did we while playing or reading, because, honestly, it is astonishing.
I&#39;d like to draw your attention to another show. The Expanse used to be on Netflix, and that&#39;s actually how I first became aware of the show. The Expanse is adapted from a book series with the same name, and there are some changes. For example, in the book series, Earth and Mars are allied against the Outer Planets Alliance, but in the show, Earth and Mars are two rival powers, with the OPA sort of being their own third faction. On paper that seems like a fairly big change, but in reality, it isn&#39;t. Without spoiling anything, the plot plays out exactly the same way. Mars is still Mars, Earth is still Earth, and the OPA is still this split very very loose collection of tribes and clans occupying the asteroid belt, the Jovian moons, and the moons of Saturn.<br>Contrast this with Netflix&#39;s The Witcher, and you&#39;ll find a VERY different Nilfgaard, one that&#39;s apparently dead set on ending the world? Oh, and it&#39;s not an Empire, it&#39;s just some backwater Kingdom, that has no grasp on how to make armor. Everything&#39;s just different in the show, and I don&#39;t think it had to be. The creators of The Expanse were able to make something that at least to me still felt like the book series, although I will say I watched the first season of the show before I started reading the books. I&#39;ve since read all the books, and we&#39;ve just seen the fourth season of The Expanse on the Amazon service, and even though there are things that are a little different, it still feels like The Expanse. I actually like some of the ways the show deviated from the book series.<br><br><br>Every time Netflix&#39;s The Witcher did something different, It just kinda felt jarring to me.
Henry Cavill plays the witcher 3 when he has the chance to... said that he likes the game.
This is why I don&#39;t like talking to book readers. If it&#39;s not word for word how it was for you in the books, then you&#39;re just gonna nitpick. I&#39;m very glad they made it into a TV series and it&#39;s just gonna be different because there&#39;s different constraints. I loved Yen&#39;s backstory. I also love that they breathed to life Geralt&#39;s and Yaskier&#39;s dynamic into what I kind of saw as a play on screen.
First I&#39;m not mad at your review and I&#39;m not going to bash you.  I think you have a great channel and enjoy your walk through of the first Witcher.  But you sound a bit book snobby.  I&#39;m sorry for even saying it.  But I can&#39;t help it.  But please keep up your great work and don&#39;t ever be afraid to share your opinion.
What I just don&#39;t understand is this. The show was made from the books, right? So presumably, the show was made for people who&#39;ve read the books? I&#39;ve read the books, loved them. I&#39;ve played the games, loved them. Seen the show, hated it. So if this show isn&#39;t made for people like me, who&#39;s it made for? The people who watch Game of Thrones at a bar maybe?
I&#39;ve played all the games and read the first 4 books so far. I agree with all your points about the changes but despite that I still enjoyed the show. Not so much for myself, but I watched it with my wife and talked about it with my friends and I&#39;m glad it exists for this purpose, getting this world and series to the people I love.
Can&#39;t disagree with anything you have said, I&#39;ve watched a fair few videos of yours surrounding the lore and completely understand your perspective. I&#39;ve only played W3 and I really enjoyed the show for reasons you explained and seeing the characters develop in a way I don&#39;t know any other. Good video though
I haven&#39;t play the game or read the books but from what I heard here I think it would have been a better show if they were loyal to the material
I think your being entirely to bit picky here. First all film adaptation are fundamentally different than any book. While you&#39;re perfectly fine to have your own opinion on liking the show your reasons are based on book lore vs show lore.<br><br>Tell me did you like the original Jurassic Park?<br>Did you read the book, which the film is based on?<br>There is like a 10% commonality between Jurassic Park the film and the book.<br>Your example is a flawed one. Comparing og films and remakes is one thing and is not the same as comparing the books to the film.
Biggest fucking problem I have is everyone jumping on the Witcher bandwagon now that it‚Äôs a show.
I agree 100% but I did enjoy the show, but yea my biggest gripe was how they left out Ciri and Geralts first meeting, that changed the whole feeling of the end and not in a good way, I dont think it was implied that Fringilla was the cause of Nilfgaards rise, i can see how it looks that way, but I&#39;m sure they will explain that Emhyr took his throne back from the Usurper. I agree whole heartedly about Yens back story, complete waste of episode time, It wasn&#39;t even that interesting, and the magic changes irked me really bad too. I disagree about Geralt, Henry was the biggest redeeming quality of the show to me, and the Blaviken episode while slightly different was by far the best episode. The Dragon episode was very poorly done, they didn&#39;t even make him a proper dragon, Saskia had 4 legs and wings, and yea, I know, games, but it was crazy to me that it wasn&#39;t considered. I know Henry is a super fan of the lore, I wonder how much of his input they ignored, or shot down.
I introduced my co work to the witcher he loves it all he been watching is the episodes over and over
I liked it not because it was perfect or accurate, but because it was a fun season to watch, and that&#39;s coming from a very casual Witcher fan. I can imagine that people who&#39;ve never played the games or read the books that it can be a pretty cool watch as well. Hell, I heard my sister about it and she hated medieval stuff, but she likes books, so it&#39;s probably going to introduce her to the books. And my brother never even played Witcher 3, but now he wants to play it really badly. You see what I mean? It&#39;s good enough to introduce commoners to the Witcher world, which is only ever a good thing. More and more people will share the great times we&#39;ve had playing the games and/or reading the books. And we, especially you, get to introduce them to it and we can act all smart and cool. It&#39;s a big win.<br><br>But it&#39;s only season 1, it&#39;s calm. Netflix still has plenty of time to just royally fuck us all
Never read the books or played the game.<br>The show is 1000% GARBAGE.<br>Rather watch Conan...<br>Was super excited and now super disappointed.<br>Corny, cheesey, rushed, and BORING AF!
I agree with you mate books games much better plus adding characters annoyed me too most people that are fans of the show clearly didn&#39;t read or play games before seeing the show only characters i do like are geralt and ciri so far in series
I just really hate how fake woke Netflix is and that to me has ruined a lot of The Witcher. Not to mention the casting choice isn‚Äôt what I would‚Äôve picked. Henry Cavill is too polished to play a rugged character and isn‚Äôt Yennefer...German? Idk whatever call me closed minded but I‚Äôm sure in the dark ages there were no Indian women in Europe.
Netflix: Wanted to do something on theire own and Not make 100% the Same as the Book<br><br>You: Why did they changed things
Hi George, I appreciate the breakdown. I think you were very reasonable with your argument and points.<br>I liked the show overall, it wasn&#39;t perfect but it was a fun watch. I haven&#39;t read the books but have played the games. I thought it was a decent portrayal of Geralt and an interesting interpretation of the world and lore itself, but I can see why someone who&#39;s as immersed in the books and games would find it lacking.<br>More than anything the show had me itching to replay the games haha!<br><br>Thanks for all the great work you do, I enjoyed your video!
Cahir has the best arc in the series. He&#39;s by far the most interesting character they have aside from the main cast. Hopefully the don&#39;t do him dirty in the upcoming seasons.
I don‚Äôt read fantasy books. Sure most people are coming to this from the game or nothing at all.
Ciri not having visible eyebrows makes me uncomfortable
Eat my
Well I agreed with almost everything you said But we have disagreements about Nilfgaard. Although, Nilfgaard is not as evil like the show protrays them to be they are still the foreign Invader from the south, starting wars and invading countries. The northerners have every right to defend their homes from the southern invader. But that is my opinion and what I think about the 3 northerner wars.<br>However, despite all that the only reason why I like the northern kingdoms more is because most of the characters are from the north while few are from Nilfgaard.<br>That is the only thing we disagree on other than that we agree on every other point you made.
I think the show is good. Not great, but good. And I hope to see more of it. Henry Cavill does a spot-on Geralt voice (from the game). My biggest concern before I even saw it was, &quot;this show is going to be incredibly expensive to produce. The world of the Witcher has a huge amount of lore and locations. And showing it all is going to be very expensive.&quot; But Netflix seems to have found writers, producers and directors who know how to budget the show properly, do precision strikes with it and not just smear CG all over the place.
Don&#39;t be the Elio and Linda of The Witcher.  They are the book purists of Game of Thrones and the most hated people in the fandom because all they ever did was talk about how anything the show changed from the books was bad.  Don&#39;t be that guy.
this isnt really a review though<br>its just complaints about changes that were made<br>there isnt even much talk about why the changes are bad, its just a big list of source material changes lol
I played the game first, that was my gateway to the books, I read them all, <br>I do agree every bit of your criticisms of this show, I still loved the show and can&#39;t wait for 2nd second<br>My only issue is that they didn&#39;t play a round of Gwent first!
Honestly. I kinda like that it is different then the books and games.
it was simplified, too black and white and too much juxtaposition... I though it would be more comparable to early seasons of GOT in quality and IT WOULD if they stuck to the books.
I liked this video. I have read a few of the short stories and liked them. I like the Witcher 3 and I enjoyed the show. Each ‚Äúversion‚Äù I enjoy for different reasons. I enjoy video games. I love fantasy and I love good stories. I get it when you can‚Äôt bring yourself to not bringing yourself to enjoying this. There are some things out there that I can‚Äôt enjoy the cinema adaptations because I love the books to much. I haven‚Äôt read too much of the Witcher but I have learned enough through videos like this one to know when characters are being changed. The whole show I was confused why Ciri was not Nilfgaardean. But as a show, and comparing it to game of thrones, I thought it was a great fantasy. I enjoyed the political side of things. I thought they did a great job. The things I disliked but still enjoyed were the stories created for the show. I could just tell they were not the original stories. Geralt was the best, Ciri a gem, and the witches were tolerable. In the end, the highs in the show were my highs. I enjoyed when Geralt called upon the law of surprise. I loved when Ciri asked ‚Äúwho‚Äôs yennafer‚Äù and in that same episode how Geralt acted on the cart. Definitely an enjoyable show. <br><br>Great video as well. You gained a new subscriber and viewer because of this. I would love to watch or listen to you going thorough the show and comparing the parts form the stories with the show.
What do you think Vilgefortz getting beat by Cahir on season finale?
I got the impression the show was implying that it was the &quot;Usurper&quot; (Emhyr) that brought Nilfgard out of being a backwater country, rather than Fringilla. I agree with the criticisms though. Really enjoyed the show, but the changes (Brokilon, Cahir, Mousesack) irked me and make me worry they&#39;ll spoil some great moments and characters later on.<br><br>Also I wager they&#39;ll drop or neuter the give/take aspect of magic later on. They didn&#39;t really use that idea much beyond the initial flower/rock scene anyway.
I think my biggest issue with the show is it‚Äôs pacing. It‚Äôll be slow for somethings but, fast for others. Never read the books and haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to play the games(although I do on Witcher ). As a comic book fan trust me when I say I understand how you and a lot of the other guys in the comments feel. Overall since my knowledge of the Witcher really only consist of you, I can‚Äôt really say whether or not the shows adaptations is wrong but, I did find it to be an OK medieval kind a story.
i appreciate your opinion but i cant help but think that this videos main flaw is that you keep saying that the show got the story wrong and it isnt the same as the books, but thats the whole point of an adaptation, they adapt the story to fit the on screen world. the story is inspired by the books not copying them.
Emir var emerys is duny the hedgehog.
The show is amazing as a game fan I love it
Geralt&#39;s fight scenes and all the scenes with him and Dandelion are what made me enjoy this show, the rest I really wasn&#39;t a big fan of.
Man i love this vid, you tell every thought i have about the show
Let&#39;s face it: netflix is a joke, and so is their witcher :(
fair enough
I wonder if it would help you to turn your thoughts on this slightly to a new angle. Instead of focusing on the fact that it IS incredibly inaccurate and a departure from the lore, ask why. I have a theory that might assist you.<br><br>First, I am NO WAY as immersed in the lore as you are. I did a little poking though and quickly realized that everybody in the show has WAY more intense motivations than the games or books. Now I ask myself why. The answer I came up with is they have taken some of the shades of grey out of the stories. It‚Äôs less ambiguous of who is ‚Äúgood‚Äù and who is ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Fringella is now ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Geralt (as our insert character) is ‚Äúgood‚Äù. The theme of the games (can‚Äôt speak to the books per se) is that there is no good and evil, there are just the choices we make and their consequences.<br><br>Contrast that with the theme of the show so far: the theme is recognizing what REALLY makes a monster. The beasts aren‚Äôt necessarily monsters, but the people can be. So the eel pool shows that they had to lose a little of their humanity, sacrifice that for power and become a little monstrous. Geralt‚Äôs speech to the elf king in the mountain pass is about dwelling with humans and being a mensch and not acting like the monster people think you are.<br><br>The show can‚Äôt follow the stories exactly because they are telling different parables, and they are trying to sell it to a broader audience. In general, people NEED to know who to root for and who to boo. It helps to highlight the different theme better.<br><br>If that doesn‚Äôt help you breach the gulf between enjoying the show and being a lore master, maybe think of it as the books and games are Dandelion recording what happened and this is another bard embellishing the story second-hand from that?
Are they saying Nilfgaard is an actual backwater? Or are they just insulting a kingdom that they dont like?<br><br>Are they saying Yennefer would have kept them a backwater? Or are they saying Yennefer would have been able to keep them from invading the north?<br><br>I feel like there are different ways to interpret some of the things you are complaining about, but still a good video.
I&#39;ll just say this. Either do your job well or don&#39;t do it at all.
Henry was spot on, imo.
I completely agree with your opinion, in fact, I honestly hate this show because it lacks respect to the books in so many ways.
I never read the books. I will never, ever, play the games. But I enjoyed the series. I understand your point completely because an adaptation for the big screen or tv will hardly ever meet the expectations of someone who is passionate about the source material. I absolutely loved the ‚ÄúOutlander‚Äù books (the first three that is) because I think time travel and fish out of water stories are fun. But when I saw the first episode of the series I nearly cried. I refused to watch anymore. A bit later I gritted my teeth and forced myself to watch the series and now I can say that it was enjoyable. I just had to get over my initial distaste because I adored the books so much. I am now 106 pages into ‚ÄúThe Last Wish‚Äù and I hear and see Henry Cavill. And that is not a bad thing in my opinion. I will say that I have watched the show twice because I did not understand the different timelines. I know you understand that adapting a book or book series requires quite a bit of gymnastics to keep the story moving along. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. As for making characters more important than they are in the books I have one word - woke. Now if you want to watch something that has almost no relation to the book then I would suggest ‚ÄúMan in the High Castle.‚Äù Nearly 90% of the characters in the show are not in the book and that includes one of the main characters. And the show is far better than the book.
I&#39;ve read the books and I still enjoyed the show. I honestly thought they&#39;d change way more than they did. I was happy just because I could tell which short stories they were trying to tell hahaha. The only parts of the show that really got to me were CAHIR!!!! &gt;:(, and his fight with Vilgefortz, and to a much lesser extent how many, many of the characters look (told my friend it seemed like the show was set somewhere in Africa instead of Poland :P)<br><br>After you pointed it out again I really don&#39;t like the way they changed magic either though.
The show is just poorly written, plain and simple. Information is dumped on us in long winded conversations instead of showing it, too many characters are introduced too quickly not allowing us to form any connections with any of them.
Apparently you don&#39;t know about something called directors vision or book adaptation!<br>If you don&#39;t like how something is done regarding The Witcher,then too bad because your not the producer of this awesome tv show.<br>Start learning to be a director and then netpick someone elses work!!!
The show is like star trek discovery.  It&#39;s not as in depth as the original sources, but I can still enjoy it over several evenings with my wife who finds it interesting. <br><br> It could have been awful in this &quot;woke&quot; and overbearing PC climate.
I still think jim caviezel from person of interest tv show looks more like geral in the game.  I do like henry in man of steel.
You, my dear sir, have been tainted, and complain too much. That&#39;s all. Too bad. I understand tho.
Thank you for this video, hit on everything I&#39;ve had a problem with the show that&#39;s kept me from enjoying it. It&#39;s these details the writers changed or left out that could have made it so much better
The show Suuuuuuccckksss!! Huge disappointment üëé
I‚Äôm reading The Last Wish now and the girl who guided Geralt in the first episode was in the book but I think she was only mentioned. I think she was the inn or barkeep‚Äôs daughter Miranda or something. I have the book in audio so I can‚Äôt just give you a page number, sorry :). After watching the season I‚Äôm kinda glad they won‚Äôt have Yen‚Äôs transformation scene ‚Äúon page‚Äù as it were. I can‚Äôt comment on much else since I haven‚Äôt finished the first book yet though.
Alright, let me start off with saying that the only interaction I&#39;ve had with this franchise is with the third game, which I haven&#39;t even come close to finishing. So, I&#39;m not a huge fan ,who&#39;s expectations weren&#39;t met. I had decent picture in my head as to what gerald, ciri and yennifer are like, but that&#39;s all. <br>With that being said, I absolutely despised yennifer in this show. She was portrayed as a complete bitch, yet praised as being a great witch, without showing us any of her accomplishments. She treated her teacher like trash, even though she made her in to who she is. It is implied that shes lived multiple lifetimes,  but did anyone actually feel like she had anymore experience than she did when she got ascended? <br>She blames the witches for taking away her choice to have a child, even though she chose to herself and was warned ahead of time. You can be angry about it, but dont blame others for your decision.  <br>The other gripe I had with the show is about the massive leaps in logic they expected us to take. The witches of the court giving the witch working with nilfguard shit for forcing witches to fight for them, when they take innocent girls captive and turn them in to eels if they dont measure up. Gerald not using the signs whenever he has a chance (especially with the ghouls? At the end of the episode, when he got bit) Triss getting burnt because shes standing too close to the gate, that&#39;s shes blocking. Take one step back, I&#39;m sure the spell will hold. The witch forcing the other witches to turn themselves in to pure power,  twice in a row... why? It didnt work the first time, why would it work a second time. Gladly she stopped there. At times they cast spells with no effort at all, other times it depleted their life force. It was just too inconsistent for me to enjoy at times. <br>Still enjoyed it, but I&#39;ll stick to the games, which seems to treat the audience with a bit more respect .
@WitcherGeorge Hi George. Love your content. Like others said, you don&#39;t have to apologise for your opinions on a piece of media. We definitely don&#39;t apologise for liking the show. <br><br>I like the show being an adaptation of the book series. I don&#39;t think a beat for beat retelling of the story would make for compelling media for someone who knows the story in and out(could be wrong). It would be good if you found a way to put your preconceptions of the characters aside to enjoy this live action retelling of &#39;somewhat familiar&#39; stories with familiar figures. (Season 8 aside, a lot of ASoIaF fell into a similar hole wit GoT). <br><br>I find the structure quite refreshing once I got a hang by ep. 3. I feel its a good way to introduce our main characters at the same time with each one having a perspective rather than meeting other characters with Geralt. <br><br>I hope you and others alike can find a way to enjoy the show as there&#39;s plenty to like here.
I should put this on the reddit but I havent used reddit yet so... I think all of your opinions are really strong like brokilon was disappointing because I adore Dryads and sacred forests in any context and it felt so insignificant.<br> As a woman, I do really appreciate the additional screen time that all the sorceresses get because it definitely chafes to see fantasy world after fantasy world where women play minor roles and love interests. Like even in the most fantastical of settings we cant imagine powerful women. What gives? <br>One thing I really wish they&#39;d changed is why why why did they decide to make yennefer&#39;s strength her emotionality? I&#39;ve only played the games and I have aspirations to read the books (they&#39;re completely sold out where I live, go sapkowski) but I appreciated how cold and calculating she was. Her capriciousness and flailing about for purpose and meaning was weak. This portrayal along with the inclusion of her quest to have children is deeply misogynist for a show gaining acclaim as &quot;feminist&quot;. I know her seeking fertility is true to the books but when they changed so much why on earth couldn&#39;t they change that?  I&#39;m glad that you talked about the &quot;nilfgaard as evil&quot; aspect of the show. It&#39;s so childish! What drew me in to The Witcher was its approach to morality as not being total all your game choices have up sides and down sides. <br> Some of the opportunities for nuance are completely glossed over. Like I wish Yennefer had seen the girls who paid to be at aretuza and changed her mind to consider it a point of pride that Tisseia paid four marks for her  but it just wasnt even mentioned again. Jaskier gains &quot;respect&quot; for the elves but rather than spread this respect he continues to contribute to hatred of the elves with his songs because it &quot;makes a better story.&quot; Ciri hears that Calanthe is responsible for the deaths of numerous elves and it just doesnt even seem to phase her. No one in the show ever learns anything and it&#39;s really jarring.
Love the games need to read books but didnt enjoy show didnt seem right to me didnt fit or suit right and lots of mixed facts in the show that dont add up too the original story/lore
I enjoyed the show for what it was but I understand your points and I seriously respect your views on the show, games, and books. I&#39;m currently catching up on the books myself.
I totally agree with you. I hate what they did to the magic-system and to Cahill. With the rest I could live with even when I was not enthusiastic. I see here a lot of similarities to the TV series Preacher and The Boys. The TV authors didn&#39;t trust the original stories to be good enough for TV and they kucked it up.
This is so difficult for me. Read the books many times and it&#39;s in my top 2. And there it goes: I really, really want to like this show and I think I&#39;m lying to myself by saying I liked it. I did enjoy it BUT why, oh why so many changes to source material? Alot of this changes were just wrong, they cut out sooo much good and important stuff. I have no problem with adding something, like backstory of Yennefer but removing conversation of Geralt and Borch, removing Brokilon story, removing Novigrad story with Istred, list goes on. Just don&#39;t know. Finally chance for proper adaptation of this brilliant books and they just write their own stuff. My point is: I really want to understand thought process during writing.
I loved it.
I‚Äôm enjoying the series so far, even as a book and game fan. I know it‚Äôs definitely not perfect. I feel like the story they were going for was quite hard to follow unless you‚Äôve read the books. I don‚Äôt think the pacing of it is that good, but I enjoyed the portrayal of the characters within the world (and Henry Cavills Geralt imo is really good, he really became Geralt for me).
Thanks for your honest review! I also didn&#39;t like it. For me personally, I was not attached to any of the characters. That&#39;s too bad, I loved the first pc game, and i was waiting for this tv show :(
I went into the show not knowing anything about the witcher and liked the series a lot. I totally understand tho that people that have lived with the other witcher content won‚Äôt like it as much just as it happened with GOT
Well, I have read the books and put hundreds of hours into all the games. I feel that all three should be seen as separate to each other as there are lots of changes all over.<br><br>I feel that we need to see what happens as in the next season and then the next. As a first season I think it was good. Not great but good. Cavill was good, jaskier was good.<br><br>Most series suffer from a flat 1st season where certain things and character are explained and given to the viewers. Game of thrones was shit for 2 seasons until they got a bigger budget and got into the story more. The expanse wasn&#39;t great for the first season but the second and third were superb. I think we need to give it a chance to improve. The writers have already said they will change something for the next season. So let&#39;s see where they go with it.<br><br>But so far (without being perfect) it is a much better first season than GOT or the expanse which I am using as examples as they were also book adaptations.
You are straight up wrong my dude
Henry has prob watched your channel, that‚Äôs wild. But he prob appreciates your input as a fan of the books and games
Cheers for that, good video mate, I disagree with your final opinion, but that&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t need to share your opinions to enjoy your work. Good luck with your work mate (and finishing the Lord of the rings), I&#39;ll be sticking around.
That 6th episode was shite (almost all of it with the exception of the dwarves), the rest was pretty good. I take your criticisms though (Geralt being a bit of a background character), you&#39;re clearly more knowledgeable about this universe than I am. However, perhaps that is also a limitation? You come in expecting things to be exactly the same as the other productions in this universe and thus can&#39;t help but wanting things to be an extension of what you know. I&#39;d just take this as a re-imagining of the Witcher&#39;s original book. I also don&#39;t like the Nilfgardians portrayal and the hamfisted diversity casting but let&#39;s give it a chance to pick up on the character development in the second series.
Just my opinion. I like when mediums change certain things. I&#39;d know way too much if they didnt slightly alter things.<br>For instance, I enjoyed in the games that the white frost was almost an entity that could be stopped, instead of an inevitable occurence of the planet shifting from the sun like in the books.<br>When my entertainment switches mediums, changes are good to me.
I&#39;m going to get into some sort of counterclaims, but first I want to explain where I am coming from. <br>While I have read the books and played the games I&#39;m not exactly a &quot;witcher scholar&quot;, but I am with a different series and I have been through this change from Book -&gt; Series. <br>I had a similar similar approach as you did. At first I honestly really hated it because of minor differences. However, after a while I have learned to still enjoy it.  Just like the game, the game isn&#39;t exact either, what you are saying about hte series... I first felt about the game.  It isn&#39;t that is some completely wrong, but there are times it felt like it was just making shit up to so you have something to play.  But... at the same time that is part of the point. They change things to fit their needs, just as well as the series. You only have so much time to capture the audience and set a stage for the rest of the series where the books have hundreds of pages or the games don&#39;t really need to since people are not just buying it for the story. <br><br>I guess I am just trying to stay that it is going to be almost impossible to portray the books 100% in the series. I&#39;m not saying this to justify all the things they have changed, but we have to expect that there will be some major changes. Since I have sort of been through this with my obsession before, it makes it a lot easier for me to understand why they changed things. Time, budge, in trying to check the interest of viewers is very different based on the medium. <br><br>I can understand and make a lot of exceptions for most things, but I feel Ciri is just too old. It almost feels like they are trying to make her look younger, but at the same time, I don&#39;t think they can solidify the relationship with Geralt and Ciri when she just appears so old. I guess they could keep trying to portray her as younger, which it seems like they tried to do with her playing in the square, but it just doesn&#39;t feel right... I guess I just don&#39;t know how they are going to fix this or make this work out in the second series, but...<br><br>Outside of Ciri&#39;s age and finally just meeting Geralt, I think they did a great job with the series overall. It will never be the books... it is almost impossible for a series to do that, but at the same time other than feeling a bit rushed and jumping around through timelines it still pulls you into the Witcher universe.  In some ways, I am actually surprised they pulled it off so well with magic and the monsters were done very well. And I think as long as season 1 is treated as more of a background story to get everyone on board I should be alright.  However, I do get the feeling it will stray away more from the books. Although probably hitting the major events to a degree, overall I think it still has great potential as a series. It can be hard to say or hard to view a series like that since you live and breathed it for years... I have been there, but I think it is still worth the try sort of viewing it as more of an alternative timeline or something.  After I was able to do that I was able to enjoy my series.<br><br>P.S. Sorry I went rambling on in all different directions, but I&#39;ve sort of been in a similar situation and found a way to still make it enjoyable. Well before I keep rambling, best of luck! PS... However... if they somehow add Gaunter O&#39;Dimm I would give them extra points  ;)
Triss and Yenner is not hot enough and little girl is too old!! She is basically a damn adult in the show.
You need to remember that this is a series and its almost impossible to adapt a book into a series so they need to change some stuff to make it simple and shorter for the audience just like they changed some stuff for game of thrones
I think the biggest problems are just stemming from the lead writer, like, she&#39;s super self righteous already so a lot of their changes probably won&#39;t get improved upon unless the author or someone bigger just outright says no to them constantly. I feel like Netflix would have to step in themselves. I don&#39;t exactly know what the author is doing either letting all this stuff pass when he&#39;s supposed to be really hands-on. Like, D and D from GoT could do a better job atm despite the last season, because they at least listened for a while assuming the current lead writer just is ignoring the author if he is doing anything and isn&#39;t just cashing in on this advertising for his books.
I haven‚Äôt read the books, I‚Äôve just played witcher 3 several times over and have read up on a decent bit of background info and lore. And from what I‚Äôve read, I look at the games as more fan fiction than canon and from what you‚Äôre saying I feel the show should be looked at the same way. It does have its issues as a show with pacing etc but I loved it. I do have ebooks downloaded to read but given what you‚Äôre saying I don‚Äôt think I will read them yet.
I just finished this show tonight, I binged all day. I have never played the game but my husband has. I honestly didn‚Äôt know that it was a book series and surprised that my husband has never read it. We are huge fantasy fans. <br><br>That being said, having zero knowledge of the story or universe, I admit that I didn‚Äôt really like the show. It felt generic, rushed and I didn‚Äôt connect with any of the characters really, except maybe Yennifer. Now, finding out that her story is all bs is kinda disappointing. <br><br>I was a little confused with all the backstory scene jumping, but by the end I did figure it out. Being a fan of fantasy and series I appreciate your honest review. <br><br>I might watch season two, I‚Äôm not sure. The show just didn‚Äôt seem like it had any good meat to it, which is very disappointing because it seems that the books are good and this show could‚Äôve been way better than it was.
It feels like they&#39;re reading directly from the books (reading off a script) half the times.
It&#39;s too rushed.
I really respect your attitude, regarding having respect for people&#39;s opinions and their right to have different opinions. I was a pretty casual Witcher fan until the show and now I&#39;m really interested in the lore and so I&#39;m watching your videos, and this video, though we have different opinions on the show, made me respect you. :) Subscribed!
Yeah I&#39;ll admit I enjoy the show. I came into the Witcher on the wild hunt. I didn&#39;t have a PC so I never knew of the first game I don&#39;t recall ever seeing advertising for the second and I never heard of the books. But after finishing the third game I began looking everywhere for more witcher as I wanted to see the start if their journey.
The show is cool but I‚Äôve never seen lates the games or read the books so I respect your complaints
I have not read the books but I do somewhat like the change to how magic works. I think nerfing magic a bit makes it so that people can&#39;t just be like &quot;just use magic&quot; whenever there&#39;s a problem. That said the magic used in this show still feels a bit off. <br><br><br>Ciri&#39;s journey I agree felt a bit boring and pointless in the show. <br><br><br>Yennefer&#39;s backstory felt like Magneto&#39;s throughout the X-Men Movies where he loses a family every movie. We get it, your life sucked, can we move on now?<br><br><br>I&#39;m also not a huge fan of Nilfgard in the show. I feel like making them such an obviously evil place kinda works against the whole point of the series, which is every side does bad things, people are generally bad, and it&#39;s just a matter of who you believe (i think at least).<br><br><br>But again, as someone who&#39;s not quite familiar with the series, I think it&#39;s interesting and I can enjoy it.
Stop apologizing for not liking it.... Man up.    The show is getting mixed reactions.
Hey what is your opinion on Geralt of Rivia being plagiarism of Elric of melnibone?
holy than thou attitude... &quot;I know the books and stories&quot;....... you know what you took from it that&#39;s all. the wonder of art is its relative. it&#39;s ok to just say I like it... but don&#39;t use the reason &quot;because I know better&quot; nope... terrible take... we get it you play and read the witcher.
So I came into this show cold. I havent seen anything, and I enjoyed it very much. As someone who&#39;s a fan of Star Wars, I understand where you&#39;re coming from in terms of changes to the Star Wars canon. I think The Witcher series has created some kind of world building that I can get into and I would love to know more about it. And btw, I did like Luke in The Last Jedi. It created an arc and it was also 30 years since we last saw him üòÇüòÇ
i do like the show, but you have some good points there. I think they had some issues with the story over all, butthe next seasons have lot potential.
Exactly Netflix trying so hard pushing yennefer as one of the main characters... And at this point I lost all hopes for triss...  progressing with each episodes.. I feel distant from the show. Not hype for season 2 tbh.
I haven&#39;t read the books so i can&#39;t say how good at accuracy it is. But personally i enjoyed the show as it&#39;s own thing, to a degree it&#39;s sort of takes elements from the games. Especially Henry Cavil emulating what Doug Cockle did with his Geralt.<br><br>Overall i do enjoy the series and i&#39;m sorry you couldn&#39;t but that&#39;s fine we all consume things differently.
Henry caville is good, and is let down by almost everything else.
I don&#39;t get how it got a 93% audience score. It&#39;s barely a 6/10. There is just some many thing&#39;s that the show did wrong compared to the book&#39;s. The cgi was shit and the costume&#39;s are hilariously bad.
I did read the books before having any of the games (which I own but never completed). The adaptation is nice and what I want is a better conclusion than in the 7th novel: I don&#39;t disagree with how each character story ends, but I think that Sapkowski in the trashed half of the cast with very un-epic ends which felt unsubstantial.
Read &amp; loved the books, played and loved the game.  Watched and loved the show. So to say the show if for people who are unfamiliar with it is completely incorrect.  You&#39;re opinion is your opinion but I think not getting over your own head cannon is really what&#39;s mostly ruining it for you.
Here is how I think about it. There is sort of 3 universes in the witcher series. like DC.<br>1 The books <br>2 The games<br>3 The Show<br><br><br>so i&#39;m not all that all annoyed about it
I thought this was supposed to be a review of the show, not a list of things it does differently than the books. As a review, this is absolutely worthless...
I think you are missing the point of the show. The point is not to be true to the books/entertain you. The entire point of the show is to push political agendas.
As a guy that didn&#39;t read the books nor played the game, the show was ok... But backed  by the prestige of the game and the casting of Henry Cavill. A series easy to watch but difficult to catch by people out of the fandom. Very paused in some moments. I think it should have more building up in the hunting of monsters like the striga episode (come on he is a dude that kill monsters for a living and not just bump into them.. )i know os more expensive and easier to replace with boobs üòÇ. Beautiful scenearies and wardrobe. Should avoid the path of game of Thrones. Overall 7/10. Greetings from Portugal
I was so wrong and unfair judging this show by the trailers. I thought that Cavill is going to be just the worst. I thought of him to be a pretty face jock with acting skills of a hollow log. But I was so wrong. He fits this show perfectly. Because the show is just a muddled mess. An incoherent, skill-less, rushed exercise of connecting trailer shots into an hour of dull, confused narrative nothingness. The problems with it are not just neatpicky cosmetic details. It&#39;s not just that it&#39;s not like the books or it&#39;s not like the games. Those are secondary, superficial issues, a matter of interpretation, adaptation, taste and so on. The problems here though are fundamental in terms of basic story telling, plot and character establishment and development. It&#39;s starts off on the level of GOT&#39;s last season. With such start it can&#39;t get any better. Thankfully Netflix has second season of Lost in Space for some good old movie/tv making.
Remember what they changed in Game of Thrones? I was also pretty much angry because they changed and added so much and most of it unneccessarily in Witcher more than GoT. I believe those Directors and Screenwriters had too much Control. Anyway, I am happy to see Henry playing Geralt! And Yen is also not that bad. About the LotR Books - Get ready for a Half Year of intensive reading :) Now that you have seen the LotR Movies you may find less Faults in the Books than with Witcher. But you will be upset as well. It works in both Directions. At least it is not as bad as &quot;Ready Player One&quot; - I genuinly hated what they did to the Book Story! People however liked it! Give it a chance - They may have F*cked up Season one. But &quot;Blood of Elves&quot; will be more linear and allow them less Freedom! I cannot wait when Triss comes to Kaer Morhen to help with Ciri&#39;s Training. This would be a great start for the second Season.
People like you are impossible to please.
Iv played the games and seen the series. I&#39;m inspired to read the books
Despite what other comments say, I do respect your disclaimer at the beginning. It should go without saying that your opinion is yours and it shouldn&#39;t ruin things for others or be seen as an attack on others&#39; opinions, but this connection is not always made these days. Lots of fanbases can get quite combative. You shouldn&#39;t have to say that, but I respect that you did. Also, I went into this series with a blank slate as I know close to nothing about the Witcher. I thought some things were underdeveloped or needing of explanation, but overall I liked it. However, I am always fascinated by the opinion of someone who is more experienced to the source material. In my opinion, it&#39;s weird to say that something is &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; about the Netflix series because they changed it from the books. I tend to see adaptations as separate canon than the source just like how I read every Harry Potter book, but I wouldn&#39;t call elements of the movies &quot;wrong&quot; because they changed something. I just think that treating source material like it&#39;s history and stating that adaptations are &quot;wrong&quot; for changing something is not the best way to go about it as a fan. Again, this is just my opinion as a non-Witcher fan but a huge fan of many things.
Your problem is your a big fan and read the books. It&#39;s perfect for a fantasy fan who hasn&#39;t played the games and hasn&#39;t read the books. I&#39;m a huge LOTR fan and feel the same about the films because I read all the books before the films.
I thought it was very video game themed, which worked. I thought it was very removed from the real world which is great fir a fantasy piece.
Thanks for bringing some facts about books. I liked netflix show. But maybe that is due to the fact that I didnt read books. I played some witcher 2, thats all. I think they did a bad job casting some characters or producing looks of some races and armour. But hearing from you that they changed so much makes me think &quot;why they need to change good story to fit todays political narratives?&quot;. I think you know what I mean.
The emperor of Nilfgaard is Emhyr and he is Ciris father right? in the series they say her parents are dead. whats that about
I can‚Äôt say I disagree with anything you say, but I personally still enjoyed the show. Adaptations of books are rarely accurate to the source material. You are almost always going to be disappointed if you go into them with that expectation. You can just get so much more detail and exposition out of the written word that is then further expanded upon by each individual readers interpretation. This is why the book is almost always better than the movie.
I agree with pretty much everything you‚Äôve said. As someone who is also very deep into the lore and has read the books multiple times, there is definitely so much inaccurate content. And unnecessary content. And the fact they put in things that didn‚Äôt even occur makes me cringe even more. Thank you for making this video! As a whole for the show I can see why people would enjoy it. But for me, I agree with your opinions.
I‚Äôm hoping they mention the other Witcher Schools at some point. And I don‚Äôt mean the ones in game though. But the School of Cat and the School of Griffin from the book‚Äôs perspective. The Schools are what originally drew me into the Witcher/Hexer universe.
There are none that I know that I would listen to more for a professional review of a Witcher-related product than you. I felt a lot of things about this show felt completely off, but couldn&#39;t quite but words to <i>what</i> it was, but you did that so excellently. There are some more minor things that annoyed me in the show, but you really managed to eloquently dissect the major issues with the show. Cheers!
Im happy that a show was made at all. I liked the games and im sure i would love the books.  Geralt is a super hero that doesn&#39;t feel the need to wear tights unlike that other super hero that Henry plays
like I was hearing myself, perfect
I completely support your opinion on these series. I know about Star Wars and LOTR as much as your know about The Witcher. Peter Jackson in the LOTR did a good thing because he is big book fan. He himself said that he wished to make it by the letter, by the book, but he did not have enough money.  On the Disney retardation of new Star Wars Trilogy I shall say nothing more. I don&#39;t know The Witcher book lore and I would like to read it, but I can&#39;t. That is why Netfilx should first ask the real fans about something what they themselves know nothing about.
The show is decent but is lacking something, have read the books and played the games and I&#39;m not a big fan of the Netflix adaptation.
Just a perspective for you to consider: adherence to lore vs. creativity. <br><br>The strongest characters and fictional worlds can withstand interpretations by different creative leaders, for different platforms and in different times. It means that there is some strong , core archetype at heart that can be interpreted through different lenses.<br><br>Think Batman. There&#39;s campy Adam West, the demented batman from grant Morrisons Arkham Asylum, military industrial complex Batman , Frank Miller&#39;s grizzled fascist, Red Son&#39;s shadowy anarchist, the world&#39;s greatest detective Batman... they&#39;re all Batman. Lore shifts and changes across interpretations, but each brings a new lens or examines a different facet of the archetype.<br><br>Or, since it&#39;s Christmas, what about A Christmas Carol? It&#39;s been twisted in so many ways - with Muppets, with a modern day loan shark, with Blackadder, with an 80s TV exec, with the new BBC adaptation that added some very dark new back story, with a meta-take that confronts Dickens with the ghosts in his head...<br><br>I think you might have a more enjoyable time with Witcher if you take this approach. It&#39;s kind of amazing this fictional property you love so much has such a strong core that it can be  played with by other creatives with their own perspective.<br><br>It is to Witcher&#39;s credit that the cast of characters and world is solid enough to be interpreted . How cool would it be to see what would happen if writers like Mark Millar, Neil Gaiman, Gail Simone, Charlie Brooker etc got their chance to play in the Witcher sand box?
I don&#39;t think not keeping to the source material was the only issue for the show. I was looking forward to binge watching it over a weekend when it came out, but I just stopped watching in the middle of the season. It was just boring. There was no suspense or actual plot and character development. It was like the show creators had a bunch of characters and points they wanted to check off as introduced without a care for whether it is going to make sense or interest the audience. I did eventually get back to finishing it, but I was really uninterested and played on my phone simultaneously. Shockingly, I did not miss much...<br><br><br>It seems to me that it was a mistake to greenlight the show for whole bunch of seasons before even the first episode was filmed. It certainly removed an incentive to make it as good as possible to get a decent following and be greenlit.<br><br><br>Funny thing is, that I was thinking that maybe I am not as up to date on the lore as expected for the show to be interesting for me :D I never played the games an it is over a decade since I read the books.
George, I have to say that, I sympathise with you, regarding every opinion you have with the Netflix show. I dislike it, they simply took away the many valuable aspects in the books, and replaced them with many random things. The production team seems to forget the show is called Witcher, so it should be about the Witcher, Geralt of Ravia. I get the idea they want to expand the backstories of other characters, but at least make them reasonable. <br><br>Another major issue is that, in the original books, you will hardly find an one-dimensional character, nothing is black and white. But in the show, we get this one-dimensional evil Nilfgaardians, and their (forgive the language) stupid armours, it&#39;s just so out of place, so wrong. And I absolutely hate the portrayal of Cahir, if they want to show him fine, why don&#39;t show Cahir through Ciri&#39;s vision or nightmare or something, showing him as a person took a lot of atmosphere away.
God, I hated Yen in the Netflix series
Haha you are so kind, almost too kind. I respect it, but try and not worry too much about angry people online. There lives goes on as well, there is so much criticism to be said towards this show from a fan standpoint. And let&#39;s be honest, fans are gonna react even if they make the show to pander to mainstream fantasy enjoyers in general. The show gets more praise than criticism so don&#39;t worry too much. Good review mate!
Hey what about a video on how the witcher order was created, like who was the first witcher and how was he created?
Thank god for good review, I whose thinking that I whose only 1 who think that this show is more about woman power and this nonsense. Because its more about bitchier then witcher... and this is what happened when female is creating the show. Im just hoping Geralt will show more like what we seen in mandalorain tv show.... dude you are the best fk all thw rest üòÅüçª
I feel very mixed about it mostly negative about the lore of the show and how they portray the story vs the books and the character development. Fringilla, Ciri, Yennefer.... they butchered character development.
The show is pretty bad.  In episode 1...sigh... Eist Tueirsach is killed without even explaining who he really is.  It‚Äôs bad.  Most of the key characters from the first 2 books aren‚Äôt properly introduced nor are they explored.  At least we have the games.
I totally agree with all what you have said, i feel the same way about that bad changes they made, and mainly i&#39;m mainly disappointed with Ciri &amp; Geralt plot as in the books Geralt kind of walked from his destiny to be with Ciri two times, once when he visited Cintra and another after he found Ciri in Borkylon and returned her home. These incidents add a lot to Geralt &amp; Ciri relationship, as he was always trying to escape his destiny but the third time &#39;much more&#39; it get him go fully accept his destiny by taking Ciri as his daughter.<br>In the show it&#39;s somehow doesn&#39;t make much sense, those who read the books will understand what i&#39;m referring to.
Made a comment a few days ago giving my opinion and accidentally deleted it. Also had a few people that was triggered by my comment, which puts a smile on my face. Overall show is a 6/10. <br><br><br>Show definitely needs improvements but it&#39;s not bad. <br><br><br>I don&#39;t like the choices for Yennefer, Triss, Foltest, and a number of others(No it&#39;s not because i&#39;m racist so quit assuming. Yes i&#39;m making an assumption that you triggered fanboys are calling me racist because that just the type of world we live in.). But the acting was good so i guess that&#39;s something. <br><br><br>And lastly the models for the dragons were terrible.<br><br><br>I&#39;m sure i&#39;ll still get a bunch of triggered people commenting cause apparently we live in a world where you&#39;re labeled as hating something or a racist just because you don&#39;t like something, And as i stated above i liked the show but it needs improvement.
The way I see it, the show is just another story using the characters and various elements of the world depicted in the books. I take it as some kind of alternate version. Like Full Metal Alchemist and Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
I liked this show a lot, however I had a hard time following it. Beautiful effects
It should just be called Yennefer the Mary Sue Sorcerer.
I didn&#39;t read the books.....I feel like the season was maybe rushed, and I felt like there were some plot holes in the way magic works.......I don&#39;t know?! Maybe it will get better?
Why does Geralt suddenly believe in destiny, the moment he sees ciri? He is even asked this directly and he denied it, and also In THE SAME EIPSODE scolds his mother because she believed in it.<br>Also it feels like heavily pandering to sjw fantasies, every ever so small &#39;strong female role&#39; just HAS to be explored. Story about the last dragon? No hes male, he needs two completely story- unrelevant female bodyguards, oh and let them be black for more diversity points. good soul of a mother aparrently goes after ciri, after she just stole one of her two horses to take her in and to tell her shes had everything, but forgets to mention her fucking husband. not fitting in this grim mideval world without further explanation, like let the audiance know that the husband died to save refugees and suddenly her motivations are clear and understandable not just another generic strong female<br>Why is the Queen the ruler and not the king? Seems kinda off to me but maybe thats in the books. <br><br>Cavill does really well portraying his (side)character, Yennefer gets way too much exploration in my opinion<br><br><br>all in all i can say enjoyed most scenes with geralt, good fighting scenes, good cgi (exept maybe the dragons), but it seems to me that its been written by way too political people who wanted to turn this series into some kind of third wave feministi empowerment commentary
I‚Äôm half way through the books and I still enjoyed the show. I do understand your frustration
You worry too much about offending your nameless anonymous internet viewers. Just say whatever you want.<br>However, saying every different thing the show does to the books is incorrect is pretty lazy. The show does have a lot of problems worth discussing, but differences and artistic liberties are to be expected.
Thanks for the video! everyone is, of course, entitled to their own opinion about it, but heres mine. First, though, where im coming from: im still watching the show, at about episode 6?, I have played the 2nd and 3rd games and read all of sapowskys books. I still find the show to be very enjoyable though. Clearly, adaptations like this are normally tangentially related to their source material at best, and with the quality and detail of the source material I honestly did not expect much of the show going into it, so perhaps that influenced my opinion somewhat. I agree that nilfgaard, as well as their relationship to magic, was disappointing, I found the comparison of their strict control of magic to the relationship between kings and mages in the north one of the best political points in the novels. But i do think geralt was done very well in the show, at least far better than I expected going into it, and i personally liked the added background given to yenefer. I found it nice that the show was introducing new material there to be honest, and aside from the eel things and so on a lot of yenefers story was drawn fro (oblique) references in the books. The events of the different timelines were also compiled in a way so as to complement each other too - like geralts encounter with filavandrel to highlight human-elf tensions just before those impacted the other stories. I was not a big fan of some of the more tangential characters though, especially triss, and of course the nilfgaardians. Others, such as mousesack, were done very well though. overall, it was a strange mixture between elements that were executed in a manner well exceeding my expectations, and ones done more poorly, but since i was not expecting too much going into it - the bar, lets face it, being absurdly high as regards the lore integration between the books and games - it was very enjoyable
sad why only one season on Netflix it was getting good
I&#39;d watch a video detailing the differences
Loved the books and the games.  Not wild about the show.  I hated the editing and pacing.  Acting was good, casting wasn&#39;t bad either.  But I found the show dragged and is unnecessarily confusing.  When you&#39;re half way through a season and wondering what the fuck is going on than find out you&#39;re watching chapters of a story in different time lines is just plain annoying.
So I did really like the show, no I haven&#39;t read the books but I am a big fan of the games. After watching the show I felt like playing through the games again and so I load a new game of Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and almost immediately in the battle camp at the start of the game you run into the Reavers. Now before I had no idea what they were talking about, some adventure with Geralt where they were racing to kill a dragon, whatever, but now having seen (a version of) it it struck just how different their recount of the story is to the what was shown in the show, like events that simply did not happen.<br><br><br>Now I still enjoy the show, in fact I watched it through again while playing the games but that one moment just shows how different the shows interpretation is to the book stories.
I feel like when they get into the main bit in the next season with geralt and citi together might be more true to the story.
I love your review. Just stumbled on your channel. I am not versed in The Witcher lore at all,  the games nor the books... nothing. I didn&#39;t like nor dislike the show. I came for Henry Cavill.  I had too many questions while watching. Your review does clear some things up for me so I will be content to live vicariously through your channel. Thank you for your commitment.
My only casting issues are Triss and Fringilla, the rest are fine. Henry Cavil does a great Geralt and I&#39;m willing for Ciri to be aged up to give us better acting.<br><br>In terms of worldbuilding the show so far has been too vague and simple, hopefully next season they give us a better grasp of the world. <br><br>When it comes to book comparison I don&#39;t really care all too much. I&#39;ll compare the two stories when this is complete, until then I&#39;m not gonna criticise the show for not being 100% on the mark. As long as the bigger story beats are met in a satisfactory way, I&#39;m willing to let some smaller things go. <br><br>Finally, I see no issue whatsoever with the writers fleshing out Yen&#39;s character. I totally get the &quot;stick to the source material&quot; point of view, but I don&#39;t adopt it much. Sometimes adding on can improve the story (not claiming it does or doesn&#39;t in this instance), just look at the Shawshank film.
Thank You for this Video!  As somebody who has read the entire book series 3X‚Äôs, invested almost 340hrs playing the Witcher 3 Game &amp; all of it‚Äôs DLC‚Äôs, exploring every inch of the Game‚Äôs World. Also Someone who has spent a ton of money on Witcher Collectibles, and Collector Artwork from Cook &amp; Becker, You nailed it exactly how I felt after watching the entire series.  Overall I thought the acting performances where very good, but it‚Äôs the show‚Äôs structure, information, writing &amp; direction that is fundamentally flawed.  In a nutshell, It‚Äôs Not My Witcher.  Hopefully the 2nd season stays true to lore, &amp; and core of the books.
Don‚Äôt assume that people who like the show don‚Äôt know anything about the lore. It‚Äôs ignorant.
I do think you are being extremely particular about how the show is being written. I never heard anything about this being a beat for beat retelling of the books. I‚Äôm a big Witcher fan, I‚Äôve read the books twice and played the games. The show is good yet pretty incoherent especially to newcomers due to the jumbled timeline and short stories format. Who doesn‚Äôt want yen‚Äôs back story? First season has problems but season two with a more linear storyline could be amazing.
To be honest, I think that they added/left out things in order to make it more appealing to a general audience. Leaving things out with regards to Brokilon to make it easier to let everything come together at the end of episode 8, so Geralt and Ciri unite for the first time and that is somehow supposed to be a satisfying(?) ending to the season. If they had met before, this would be less &quot;neat&quot; in a way. Same story with Yen, really. By adding the stuff that makes her lifestory so far basically look like a teenage drama-coming-of-age thing it is supposed to be more appealing, I think. She is the definition of an empowered woman at the end. Thing is, she loses all her magic (apologies for the pun) because of it. All mystery is gone. She becomes another average mage character in a fantasy series. The whole reason I personally love the Witcher universe is the fact that all of it is so grey. There is not a whole lot of black and white going on, and if there is that is usually an illusion - which you find out later. To make it more accessible they do what people are used to - black and white stories with good guys (the main characters) and bad guys (Fringilla, and the whole Nilfgaardian Empire with all its citizens in addition to that). It partially loses its appeal that makes the Witcher universe so cool to me, so realistic. I did enjoy watching the series though, and as I watched I was looking things up when they did not make sense. I think they also did a poor job making clear what was going on, as the viewer only really understands that the storylines are set in different times a few episodes in, especially if they do not know much or anything about the story itself already. Again, I understand why (they wanted to get all of the short story material out of the way, tie it up nicely and then continue with the &quot;main&quot; course, the series of books), but this also detracts from the series for me personally. The series is supposed to do well with a general audience, which logically leads to simplification and catering to that audience. It will disappoint you if you read up on the lore, and know it in detail. In that way, every movie and series can be disappointing. I personally chose to try and ignore it, and enjoy it for what it is. I do like it, it is just not EVERYTHING I had hoped for. Its still a solid 7 out of 10 for what it is, in my opinion. <br><br><br>Just as a note, I am not an expert on the lore - I have only played the games. I do read up a lot as I watch/play along, but I have yet to read the books, which are certainly on my to-read list. I was kind of disappointed to find that a lot of events were simplified, changed or left out (or even added). But hey, was it realistic to expect a series for hardcore fans?
It was an okay show, nothing great. Henry Cavill played Geralt well, Ciri was good but Yennefer didn&#39;t work for me at all. the fight scenes were great and Dandelion was funny. <br>Im not trying to be racist and im not even white myself but I just feel like the multiculturism is so forced that it does not work in a medieval setting. And the Nilfgaard ball sack armour fucking hell that is the worst shit about the show.
In my opinion Witcher from Netflix is just soulless
Basically &quot;the book was better&quot; xD which is often the case. I loved the show, I love geralt, I love the world. I thought it was amazing.
So as a person who hasnt read the books but has played the games quite religiously i thought the show did a great a job. To me it seems like most of your gripes with the show are that it isnt a direct interpretation of the books. Which is fine. But you have to realize as a show its hard to throw random characters in with zero back story especially if they want then to be a main focus. Thats why i think they went that route with yen. Henry was a great geralt and you can tell hes passionate about the character. The plot wasnt incredible but it was a great start and i thought it wrapped up quite nice.
I had high hopes for the series but it&#39;s kinda lame imo. I find myself not really liking any of the characters.
Thing for me is:<br><br>I actually agree with everything you said in your video. All these changes are weird and I don&#39;t know how they&#39;ll &quot;fix&quot; It later on.<br><br>BUT at the same time, I can&#39;t help but be excited for the show. I don&#39;t know if it comes from the fact that I&#39;m an old fart so I remember seeing Batman be butchered on screen time and time again until Nolan came around. Or basically any geek/nerd IP butchered back in the day. <br><br>What this signals to me, is that Witcher is extremely popular now. It has potential. Hopefully the other seasons will be better. But if they aren&#39;t, at least it&#39;ll hopefully mean we might get a movie or a reboot in the future. Maybe even more books and games and THAT is the most exciting thing for me. The interest is there. Hopefully it stays.
Off topic but, would you say that the school of the wolf medallion in W3 is made out of pure silver or a silver-blackish material?
I loved it.
Good Points from Netflix&#39;s Witcher<br>- Knew nothing of this IP til I got the notice of it on my netflix, binge watched it and loved it.<br>- Youtubed witcher, found your channel, been immersing myself in witcher lore, I understand the show will be different.<br>- Just bought Witcher 3, will start playing it tomorrow ^_^.<br>- Witcher 3 sells have skyrocketed since the netflix show, which means more gamers to share all your lore with :D, myself included!<br>- Because of all this hype maybe the next upcoming witcher game will have a very nice budget.<br><br><br>Love your content.
Never read the books or played the games, just watched the show and judging it on just that, i dont think its a good show. I thought the first few episodes were great. But the writing especially around Geralt and Yennefer made it seem very un-natural and rushed to see him completely fall in love with her after 30mins ( like Jon Snow and Daenaerys)- which seems really out of character for the stoic and complex  Geralt. Again dont know if it happens this quick in the books but its my opinion and you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to voice yours.
Have your opinion man. About a third of this video was you apologizing for having one. And like you I&#39;ve read the books and loved them. Overall I liked the show though, I thought Henry fucking killed it as Geralt. I think Geralt is a hard character to play for a lot of reasons and Henry got a lot of it right. He had a &quot;hideous smile,&quot; he&#39;s rough around the edges, and he makes mistakes. The rest of it I agree with. Especially, Cahir. That shit was just terrible. If they were afraid of character bloat just introduce Tawny Owl, who is important later on to do the evil shit. Or the General who actually led the army at Sodden Hill. He&#39;s important later on with Brenna and everything else. The only part worse than Cahir&#39;s character assassination was the lack of connection between Geralt and Ciri. Also, that final fucking line &quot;who&#39;s Yennefer?&quot; WTF is wrong with the something more line? It&#39;s perfect, it&#39;s memorable, it&#39;s powerful. Lastly, I hated the changes to magic like you said. I also think showing Yennefer&#39;s backstory will make it harder to do Ciri&#39;s training. We&#39;ve seen one mage being trained. Are we supposed to sit around and watch Ciri&#39;s training as well? Now they&#39;ll have to come up with even more bullshit to show or show us the same stupid training and really ruin shit.
While it&#39;s true that &quot;everyone has an opinion&quot;, we should not use it as a phrase to shield ourselves from criticism esp. when we place ourselves in the public sphere. And while it is fallacious to attack a persons &quot;feeling&quot; on a particular topic, it&#39;s absolutely reasonable to strike at the reasons for that particular feeling.<br><br>First, is your frame. It&#39;s reasonable for you to use your frame of reference, The Witcher books, as a means to critique the Show (which you acknowledged it to be your framing at the start of your video), but took that frame to an extreme. Your reason for not enjoying the show, as part of the Witcher universe, is because the show fails to follow the books to your exact expectations. This is still not wrong by any means (even if I believe your critique is based on unreasonable expectations), however, later in the video you invalidate your own framing. Because it‚Äôs your opinion, you can create any metrics to determine Goodness. It‚Äôs later in your video that you attempt to describe the metrics when discussing alternate universes within games, and when you used the new Star Wars movies as evidence for those metrics.<br><br>First, you state that ‚ÄúThey‚Äù create games and change lore, and that ‚ÄúThey&quot; use it as justification to change characters and lore within the Show. You then attack that argument as irrelevant and because games are created as an ‚Äúalternate universe sequal type thing&quot;. You‚Äôre wrong in that a T.V. adaptation cannot be the same. A T.V. show can be whatever it wants just as much as a video game, and both can be as faithful, or loose, to the source material as the writer wants. Side note, I‚Äôve watched many of your lore videos to which you happily use the game, which you just claimed does not have to remain faithful to the source, as a reliable and source to explain the Witcher universe; yet, you do not afford the same opportunity to the T.V. show. Your attempting to dismiss an argument based on what you want vs. what the fact is.<br><br>Second, you compare the first point I made with the story of Star Wars, more specifically, the changes made in the last three movies. It seems you have missed the reason why people (in general) were upset with the new Star Wars movies. It‚Äôs not so much that characters and canon was changed, rather it‚Äôs the fact that things were changed in such a manner that either was never explained , and/or those changes were absolutely unbelievable within the Star Wars universe. The prime example is when Luke raised his saber against Kylo when Luke failed to do the same against his father. Luke believed  in the good in people, not the bad. That is Luke. The writers of ‚ÄúThe Last Jedi&quot; lazily wrote it up as a moment of weakness when Luke never expressed that weakness in the past. (And yes it‚Äôs lazy writing when Luke‚Äôs reason for going to the island changes multiple times) This is the metrics.<br><br>You spend an entire video nitpicking (by your own admission) that the Witcher show fails to follow the ‚Äòcanon&#39; while justifying Luke‚Äôs change in character that fails to follow established canon. You‚Äôre absolutely entitled in your opinion as to why you believe the Witcher does not hold true to the Witcherverse, however your reasoning for that opinion does not hold up to your own scrutiny; thus, your opinion is unreasonable. You use the Books (established universe) as a metrics to determine ‚Äúgoodness&quot; while simultaneously refuting arguments that point to the same metrics, while using the the Witcher games as a metric to determine Lore within the Witcherverse while simultaneously refuting the idea that games follow an established universe. Put simply, you argue with a biased towards the Books thus rendering your critique of the Show as ‚Äúbad&quot;.<br>Yes I‚Äôll still view your content and even Thumbs up your video.
Is this an actual review or just pointing at the things they did not keep from the original works? Of course it&#39;s different. The game and the books are different, so is the adaptation. I think one of the few legit criticisms about the lack of similarities that is not plain &#39;oh no they did not copy the other media forms&#39; is the penis armor. From a true Witcher fan, you could have massively been more grateful for the things they got right, because they would have never copied the books/game.
&#39;Sorry we didn&#39;t know how to explain the magic, hopefully that won&#39;t bite us in the ass later&#39; <br><br>Like how the F did Yennefer teleport out of the desert? What elements was she drawing energy from? Sand?<br>And if its that easy to teleport (multiple times within minutes) why do people even use coach and horses?<br>People watching the show are going to think it&#39;s base on Blink logic from the X- Men.<br>Can&#39;t get into a building? Teleport. Need to get a message to Toussaint before the bad guys get there. Teleport.<br><br>Also the fight scene at the end where everyone is using their powers without much drawback, why did only one person end up withered up and die when shooting one of them magic energy balls?? It didn&#39;t happen to anyone else. The magic rules on the show are all over the place.<br><br>At the moment the fans of the books and most of the gamers don&#39;t like it. It seems the people that like this show are the same people that liked the last season of GoT.<br><br>Wait until more people get to see it or let what they watched sink in the ratings are going to drop.
Don&#39;t worry man, I like the prequels so I am hardened to people disliking things I like. Haven&#39;&#39;t watched this show though.
The Netflix adaptation is pretty good.
I think that the show is great example how to not adapt a lore. You can&#39;t adapt such a fantastic lore with fantastic stories, and make it decent tv show, you do it properly, or you don&#39;t do it at all.
thank you &lt;3
Mate, you care too much about what people think about your reviews. You‚Äôre too nice. I gave you a like for that. But some solid advice for you, if anyone dislikes your comments, just tell them to drink some cement and harden the f@ck up!!
I would recommend you to watch Alzur&#39;s Legacy though. Really want your review on that
At least make Triss&#39; hair red.. I wanted to like the series but felt somewhat bored the whole way. Am sticking to the Expanse.
The golden dragon story the limits of the possible was unrecognizable.
Yea man I completely agree with u. It really sucks bcuz I really wanted to love it but as u said they just changed too much stuff; and I get that tv is different and they couldn&#39;t go exactly by the books but the things they changed seemed completely unnecessary to me. It&#39;s like they were trying to improve the story instead of just telling it! I liked Henry Cavill as Geralt and that&#39;s about it honestly.
Speaking as a film student many of the changes were made simply out of necessity / convenience in the process of adapting a book to a completely different medium. Certain things have to be removed and certain things have to be changed or expanded when you‚Äôre making a TV show. And as someone familiar with both the games and the books you should be well aware that MANY things were also changed in the video games compared to the books. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs perfect and some stuff was unnecessary or could have been done better, but when you‚Äôre watching an adaptation you have to keep in mind that it is not the books, it‚Äôs its own unique thing. If you compare every little thing about any adaptation to the source material you are bound to find plenty of changes. I get that as someone so deeply involved in the lore you can‚Äôt help but notice that stuff, but if you take a step back and look from a broader perspective you‚Äôll see they really got more right than wrong and still more or less successfully portrayed the universe and the main characters. You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion but I think it is both unfortunate and ironic that you‚Äôre letting your love for the series stop you from enjoying its next big step.
They wanted to make Yen and Geralt similar, weird and dangerous outsiders among mages and humans, despite them being a great mage and a pretty decent human. The showrunners aren&#39;t great with these things, constantly missing their own point.
Great review, I loved the show but I haven&#39;t read the books. Although I do think you were being kinda unfair, as it felt like you only wanted a show version of the book exactly, while the show is just an adaptation. But fair enough, as someone who hasn&#39;t read the book I don&#39;t know the specific stories which they missed out or added I think your review is very realistic and fair for people like you with the knowledge. Great stuff!
It&#39;s great they made the changes, the show can have its own universe different from the book and game. The team can make a storyline unpredictable, making you fanboys cry unable to spoil. üòÅ
Thank you for this, I haven&#39;t read the books yet but from the game alone I was a little surprised with the show. Especially with the magic, I almost started to wonder how much of the game was changed just for mechanical reasons. Glad it&#39;s just Netflix being special snowflakes as usual.
I am sorry that the books ruined the show for you. ;) (As someone who only played the games, I am fully on board with what you say at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=12m40s"">12:40</a>.)
Yah as Witcher fan for decades. Who read books several times. As plays all 3 games at least 2 times can not disagree with you.  Even changes the polish show had made more sense. And games Wich different story and sequel to books had much more spirit and atmosphere from books than Netflix...
The writer of the book has been very clear, he considers any other adaption of his work non-canon, that means nothing in the game is canon, nothing in the show is canon. If you watch the show, watch it as an adaption. With that in mind, I think the show was amazing. Getting caught up in the show because it doesn&#39;t meet up with the game is a bit ridiculous, those are two non canon adaptions. I can understand trying to measure either to the books, but again, adaptions usually change things for reasons their own creators had.
I‚Äôve played the Witcher 3. Not read the books or played the other games. I wasn‚Äôt totally clued up on past lure before the 3rd game. Maybe that‚Äôs the reason I loved the show. The acting was great from Geralt, Ciri and yen. Choreography was amazing, I also liked the costume design, yes I even liked the nilfgard armour. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2.
Fuck off. This isn‚Äôt a review. It‚Äôs masturbation. Talking about I don‚Äôt like shitting on things others like and then proceeding to do just that.  The show is excellent you fkn quack.
Can someone tell me what order I got to read these books in?
nitpick away! I think it&#39;s interesting to hear how the original story of the books differ from the tv series. I enjoyed the series myself, though I haven&#39;t read any of the books and I&#39;ve only played the game. I understand why you would dislike the series though. It messed with the lore in many ways
I found the adaptation revolting. I believe their generalizing of some of the most <b>seemingly</b> innocuous facts of the story, which are transparently introduced for foreshadowing (without all the &quot;Destiny&quot; being bandied back and forth nigh infinity), were made to create a better transition for a larger and more bland audience who have not likely heard of nor engaged the Witcher series (the books or the games). I ignored the overt fact of their diverse acting cast which did not adhere strictly to the whole cast from the books, which incited these ridiculous strawman arguments of people yodelling about social justice; that was completely fine. The acting just did not hit it off with me; and Henry Cavill moreover is rather average an actor in my eyes and very much overhyped. I pity and regret the butchering of Ciri&#39;s and Geralt&#39;s  relationship origin. It was as though they believed shouting &quot;Destiny!&quot; was enough cementing of story/ relationship between Ciri/Geralt/Yennefer.
I honestly enjoyed the show and fall into the &quot;doesn&#39;t know much about the lore&quot; category.  Television shows rarely do full justice to books as one is just a deeper and more patient medium, so I am certainly not saying you are wrong to prefer the books.  What I would say is that for you as a professional, this series offers an amazing opportunity for you to reach a different, larger audience than you have for the past 2 years.  This show brought me to your channel.  While you don&#39;t need to like the show more than the series, you can use the show and the potential audience it affords you to expand interest in the series.  Just my opinion.
The show is amazing! It fucks with the books. The game is absolute shit
I agree with you on having an opinion and I believe yours is valid.
no it no cool. bc u no cool. u cu
my biggest complaint is ciri does not sound like my iphone!
have u even played any of the witcher game?
what was ur expectation of the show?
r u a dota player? seems like u did this after losing spree.
So U don&#39;t like it because it diverted from the book?
Something you dont seem to understand is that the show is an adaptation of the books. A lot of things are different and lot of things are the same. These things that are different are not &quot;wrong&quot; when they are not even meant to be exactly like they are in the books. Many things are kinda like in the books but still different, some  things will be added and other things will be left out. Thats how it must be done honestly. It would not make a good TV show if it was full-on word to word copy of the books.
I love the witcher but hated this Netflix show! Its like a stage play version of witcher!  The last eps with talking dragons was the final straw! But the producer hasn&#39;t got a shed of talent in her! She only done a few crappy Netflix stuff
What also baffles me is that Sapkowski dislikes the games but apparently loves the show...but well his opinion can be bought with money (netflix deal, new CDPR deal) so it&#39;s not worth much, not a guy with a lot of integrity.
and yes, please make a nitpicky video<br>I wholeheartedly agree, that they made up a lot of pointless stuff, which in turn took away time from the source material and proper character development.
I read the first two books in preparation for the show (I planned on reading the full saga anyway after loving Witcher 3) but I read those two just because the show was coming.<br>I mean, I get that you know way more than I do currently about the lore, as you say it is your job. However you have clung on way too hard to the comment about Nilfgaard being a backwater town, and Yennefer would do a bad job. Those comments can EASILY be interpreted as someone deliberately downgrading/insulting both Nilfgaard and Yen. I don&#39;t think anyone seriously said that Nilfgaard was backwater, or that Yen was a bad sorceress. Take a step back from your personal reservations, and rewatch that scene as if it was being used as an insult, not a proclaimation of fact. I think you&#39;ll see it.<br><br>Anyway, I agree they did change a lot (from book 1 and 2 that I know anyway). I assumed the Yen stuff while she was still a hunchback covered in the show, would be shown in later books as flashbacks or something, so it&#39;s a bit disappointing to hear that this was all original show stuff. But I get it. They needed to introduce Yen and Ciri as main players much earlier in this show than the book. They only have 8 episodes, and the show can&#39;t be about one man the entire time. I think this counts for a lot of the time line jumping as well (there are scenes with Pavetta/Calanthe, followed immediately by scenes of Ciri running through Brokilon, which as readers we know take place many years apart) but it&#39;s just the nature of the beast. Books don&#39;t generally translate word for word. I&#39;ve really enjoyed the show so far, sure the books are better, and sure Henry&#39;s acting gets a little wooden when he shouts (Game Geralt will forever be the Geralt in my head). But it&#39;s a damn good attempt. I hope season 2 is as good or better.<br><br>P.S Your videos were super helpful when I was playing the game and came across a new character, or hadn&#39;t played in a few weeks and needed to refresh something. Keep it up!
I definitely appreciate your viewpoint... I see it as the way I see the X-Men movies and the MCU versus their source material from the comics.  I still like the movies but I don&#39;t like the changes either... Not because I don&#39;t like changes, but because sometimes you become so invested in the lore of a character and their relationships, altering that significantly is tough
I&#39;m just gonna make a comment right now at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=5m09s"">5:09</a> - Yennefer,<br>thank you, exactly, the mystery behind her is what makes her great, and the backstory isn&#39;t really executed that well either, plus it&#39;s doesn&#39;t really serve any purpose of that character.<br>I didn&#39;t like the Yen&#39;s part of the netlix series at all.
Yeah mate. Same here for me. I realized that the series won‚Äôt ever be what I had in mind nor what I have read in the books. For me to enjoy this series I had to treat it as another intellectual property than the games and the books. Sucks as I was heavily invested in the series from its conception as an idea. But oh well.
I feel about The Witcher show as I feel about Game of Thrones. I read all the available A Song of Ice and Fire books multiple times, and so many things are off in the show, but I can still enjoy the show. I read the Witcher books and I watch the show and I play the games. I see them all as separate and if the show was exactly like the books, I probably wouldn&#39;t enjoy it, because I&#39;d know everything. There are details here and there that it pains me that they missed, which just makes the show less impactful, but I did binge the entire show in a night, so I can&#39;t sit and say it was terrible.
You seem to repeat yourself a lot when you say, &quot;If you like it, then like it.  Don&#39;t let my opinion spoil it for you.&quot;
Very good review. You took words out of my mouth
I haven&#39;t read the books and only watched a partial walkthrough of the witcher 3 but I hated the bard character. His dialogue was so cheesy and awkward. I just assumed it was poorly adapted for the show. If that level of cringy banter was true to the books I think I&#39;ll pass on reading them tbh.<br><br> Frankly Gerald annoyed me too. His &quot;edgy, sarcastic, brooding&quot; nonesense had my eyes rolling 90% of the time.<br><br> I did like the Yennefer origin story though. But I ended up disliking her after her ascension about as much as the bard character. <br><br>I can&#39;t think of a single character in this show I actually liked by the end.
It was pretty disapointing, Ciri&#39;s stroy was butchered, and I mean like ok chage it but at least change it well. Niflgaard&#39;s armor was a joke, also armor in general was literally made of cardboard. Yen&#39;s story was ok altought unecesary, Geralt was done right so was Jaskier/Dandelion, Cahir is a new character, he was just asigned to get Ciri on in the battle I don&#39;t think he was even a commander and he&#39;s an army general. Fringilla wasn&#39;t so early in the story doing stuff with Niflaard and her character is kinda lame. <br>Also another complain I know there will be a lot of buthurt people about this but idc, black elves don&#39;t exist, wanna play an elf use makeup, even whites need makeup imo since they&#39;re supposed to be really pale, so yeah. Also it feels like Offeir and Zerakania had a mass imigration there, funny how there aren&#39;t any arbian(maybe Vilgefortz who now also is apparently a duelist and not a mage that can spit fire out of his hands but can summon swords instead -_-.) only one asian who plays that random elf, also no indians, whitch shows the hypocricy of their &quot;diversity&quot; bullshit and that they mainly care about blacks since they&#39;re the &quot;minority&quot; there, it bothers me because it&#39;s also not faithfull to the source material and it hurts casting, I dont mind diversity even if it binds the lore a little but when you pick a certain race actor instead of the best performer just cuz you want diversity well that&#39;s a problem. This show is a greay oportunity to be more sexualy diverse inclusive I mean there&#39;s many characters who are bisexual or lesbian or such, and black people could have many many roles in Ciri&#39;s trought the desert and the Nilfaard empire it makes sense that Offeiri and Zerekanian people would live there. I knew they did that whole Ciri thing just to distract the fact they will still do forced diversity whitout taking performance and lore into account but everyone will be like &quot;at least Ciri is book acurate&quot;. Take an example from marvel cinematic universe if you really want diversity, they have great actors of all races, even race swaps but idc cuz they play well.
Dude I liked it, it was expected to be changes and cuts, but overall I liked it :D.
All these idiots complaining because it&#39;s &quot;not like the books&quot;...You&#39;re literally everything wrong with media. They have to make a good <b>show</b> not just a perfect adaptation. If they tried adapting a book word for word it would be horrible. Stop it with this non sense. Fucking dweebs.
From what i can deduce the complaints here are the same with a lot of adaptations, like i kept thinking back to how similar his words are to how i felt about some of the harry potter movies and i feel just like with  the harry potter movies while not adhering to the word of the book the story they gave you still feels like harry potter and is still enjoyable.
Thank you for this!<br>The show was good but people are praising it like its the holy grail of tv.<br>It has really good things like Cavill as Geralt, Yennefer is ok for me, Dandelion is really good.<br>And theres utter trash like the golden dragon cgi, the battle of sodden, the dryads.<br>Lot of bad writing and cringy scenes.
I loved the show and the point of an adaptation is to make thier own spin on an already existent story, so of course things will be different but that also means THAT NOT LIKING IT BC ITS DIFFERENT THEN THE BOOKS IS ABSOLUTELY OK. :)
See that tree next to that river? It&#39;s positioning is completely wrong, it&#39;s supposed to be 0.0002 feet to the left, as in the book...<br>In the show Geralt is 5&#39;10&quot; which is just completely incorrect...<br>The golden dragon weights precisely two tons in the book, but in the show he&#39;s 2.00000000000000001 tons which is just completely made up.... <br>Geralt has screen time in this show which is just completely pointless. <br>Yennefer&#39;s hair is black which is just absolutely ridicolous...<br>This is pointless, that is pointless, this is incorrect, that is incorrect...<br><br><br><br><br>¬†<br><br><br>This video summed up. You&#39;re welcome.
My biggest problem with the show is the actress of Fringilla Vigo, she just can&#39;t act for shit.
As a fan of the books and the games (W2 &amp; W3), i thought the show was great. Henry Cavill was pretty spot on, and Anya Chalotra knocked it out of the park. It was great to see how they incorporated some of the content from the first 2 short-story novels. Also, Ep. 7 where they bring in Vilgafortz was the coolest introduction. No pomp, no fanfare, just BOOM... Secret villain. Can&#39;t wait for season 2!
The title should be changed to Season 1 Nitpicking. I am fine with you expressing ur opinion but this is far from a review and more so a &quot;it should have been like this&quot; video. I do agree with some of ur points but this video is hardly a review of the show itself and more of a nitpicking video.
Thanks for making this video. I&#39;m not someone well-versed in the lore of the Witcher. I own all three of the games (and have for years), but have never had the time to play them.  I never read the books. But I really liked the show. I was curious what someone who knew the lore thought of the show. Thanks.
Just review the god damn thing and don&#39;t give a shit about the delicate fuckers.
The new Star Wars movies are technically remakes.
You say a lot of stuff was changed but so what? Just cause it&#39;s changed doesn&#39;t make it bad. You rarely give justification. Like yenn&#39;s story being told and her development in the show is one of the best parts we see her go from this person who thinks nothing of themselves to a super powerful witch who is not to be fucked with. You have this point that the show made her seem incompetent like she would have left nilfgard a back water but the show never does that. That&#39;s just something stregapor (don&#39;t know how to spell his name or nilfgard for that matter) said to discredit her and Tissaia it&#39;s not actually true. the thing with ciri going into the forest served a few purposes. she was faced with a choice she could stay in the forest during the waters and move past what she has faced or to continue the search for Geralt. When a character has to choose like that you get to see what type of person they are. Also the golden dragon was literally saving a life that sounds pretty chivalrous to me Geralt helped because he&#39;s a Witcher and has been taught to save dragons yenn helps because a. She wants to kill that one guy and b. She has no reason to kill the dragon anymore. My main problem with your complaints tho is that it seems like you&#39;re mad things are different but these differences are not necessarily bad. You split things into a binary of right and wrong when it&#39;s simply an alternative. That&#39;s what adaptions are. Adaptions are never meant to be carbon copies. If they don&#39;t bring something unique or better to the series then it&#39;s always gonna be an okay or subpar adaption. These things the games the books the series all do things differently. Treat them as alternative versions of the same stories and concepts almost like alternative universes. I do agree with one point tho Vilgefortz should have NEVER lost to Chaim TF was that.
It sounds like you&#39;re a bit burnout on the story.  I don&#39;t expect too much from shows and that helps me not be so disappointed.  I think you made a mistaken interpretation the show said about Milfgar.  The Queen said at one time it was a back water before they became a formidable force.  She teased them about still being a back water, but knew they were a formidable force since they were conquering other kingdoms.
Man, I completely agree with you. When I leaned about that the directors started changing characters races, I lost interest.<br>My brother started watching it and told me about it, and it ruined it for me even more. I read all the books, played the games, hell I even play gwent. I recently picked up Thronebreaker and I thought it was amazing. That is how you tell a book story in the perspective of a game, it stayed true to the source material (very little changes) and it just added to the book and lore.<br>This netflix series does the exact opposite, it ruins The Witcher for the fans who actually care about it. Such a shame, it had so much potencial and a good budget too...
Tldr: it was a good show. But it was not a carbon copy of the games or book.
This show was awesome.....I read the books and played the games and STILL loved the show.
3 episodes in and so far it&#39;s pretty okay. I like Henry as Geralt, he sounds and looks the part. <br><br>However, the novelty is starting to ware off. It feels pretty corny, the forced diversity is distracting (I don&#39;t care what anyone says, that ain&#39;t Triss) and I&#39;m getting really annoyed at the lack of focus (stop cutting away from the Striga fight to show me Yennefer&#39;s transformation, just do one scene at a time!)
It is better than most book/game adaptations and  at least its not like that doom movie
I would love your thoughts on the difference in different mediums, like how the video games characterizations of Ciri/Triss/Geralt differs very greatly from the books. The show, while agree that it&#39;s a bit difficult at times because of major changes from the book, I think it&#39;s successful is captivating a new audience.<br><br><br>I&#39;ve never had more people asking me about the fantasy series that I really like than now, and I would say that&#39;s fairly indicative so some bit of success. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s not a 1 to 1 adaptation of the books so it has its own legs to stand on, but I get where you&#39;re coming from.<br><br><br>Also, the Vilgefortz thing confused me at first, but I think he was Sandbagging so Yen would take her eyes off of him, which is further supported when he kills the mage after she stops monitoring him. Seems like a Double Cross to set up his agenda for the following seasons.<br><br><br>Fully agree with the oddity of Cahir&#39;s character and the portrayal of Nilfgaard. Maybe this was a change for ease of casual viewers and the stories are a bit dense.
FFS just review it, dont apologize for your fucking opinion, i couldnt even get to the video , you made me sick with all your whining to start the vid.
I like the Netflix Show, but completely understand that others may not.  Hell, we&#39;re ALL fans at some level, right?
Hm, you are right about most of the stuff, but some changes I liked. For instance the Yennefer change. There are not 7 books to build her character and story and had to be build rapidly. Imagine not having the Yeneffer story in the books and some random chick mage popping up from time to time.<br><br>Also imagine the show without a main villain. There is no such show
I liked the show, but I understand your points and they are very valid, changing the story from the books dramatically is never good. It&#39;s a great story, so why change the story, have some respect for original author he did come up with all this shit for us.<br>Things I didn&#39;t like about the show are:<br>1. Nilfgaard being a caricature of bad people and religious nuts.<br>2. Casting for Triss, I can get over this one, but the game version was so epic.<br>3. SFX and creature design, toss a coin to your VFX company, creatures are mediocre, games did a much better job and got and lotr set a high standard.<br>4. PC culture being badly implemented<br>5. No explanation of the timeline, and no clue or visual difference between the past and present. I did get what was going on, but it was confusing.
This season was just trying to introduce the entire Witcher franchise to ppl outside the gaming and book group so they had to portray it as a fantasy world. I hope later on they get things straight out
I agree with your opinion.. there were changes in the show that were completely pointless.. it left me wondering why they would change such things
I mean i understand your  viewpoint and i agree with some of them like, i didn&#39;t need to know the backstory of yennefer  because yennefer in the books is not meant for that  atleast for me.(But i understand why they did it. They wanted to link ciri geralt and yennefer and they did so this way)  or  at the end  i don&#39;t get the relationship between Geralt and Ciri. But for example i don&#39;t understand why people see Nilfgaard as evil in the show to me it&#39;s still just a southern kingdom invading north. yes they use forbidden magic but is that it . Is Yennefer evil because she used forbidden magic. No i don&#39;t think so. Personally i enjoyed the show for what it is and i have to say i did not expect anything when i first saw the cast i said &quot; fuck this is just going to be an sjw shitshow&quot; maybe that  was the reason i enjoyed it that much because my expectations were so low that even the slightest good thing made me feel better about the show.
I feel as a stand alone show it&#39;s good, I really like it like that but I do agree with your point that it isn&#39;t accurate to the witcher law.
Normies and &#39;stans&#39; are going to 100% ruin the witcher fandom. Its already started.
Every adaptation from the books are the same. The books are always better. I read the books, played the games and this show is great and as true to the books than any other show does. The only change i didnt like was how Geralt meet  Ciri and at the end when he does see her she runs to him and then ask who is Yennefer? Over all i loved the show and cant wait for season 2.
Henry was amazing as Geralt. Loved the show!
The show sucked a lot of ass man.  Sloppy dialogue, poor casting, terrible script. Ill watch season 2, but only because its the witcher...thats it.
that bit with cahir i agree completely. i mean i was so angry when they basically made him into some discount kylo ren. i mean i dont hate the show but the whole cahir and nilfgaard bits are just...so wrong.
This was a TV show based on, not lifted from the books, criticising it for being different from the books is a bit redundant. I wasn&#39;t keen on the casting of Yennefer but other than that they did a pretty good job.
Majority of your dislikes is on the fact, that it was ADAPTED to portray a totally different storytelling format with different pacing and atop of all to be tied together from the short stories.<br><br>I get it, you liked the brown bear so much, but the changes he did when he adapted to be a polar bear is too much for you to like him anymore.
It‚Äôs not a direct copy of the books so its bad Okay smh ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0gfxr13Kos"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0gfxr13Kos</a><br>This vid was a year old<br>Your making me confuse about yen
Muh inclusion and whamen power, brought a good show down, shame
I agree with a lot of what‚Äôs said here but I don‚Äôt understand the points about adaptations. Why is there an expectation that a faithful adaptation is completely impossible? They could‚Äôve remained far more faithful to the source material but then the writers wouldn‚Äôt be able to simplify the plot for general audiences or to cram extra fight scenes instead of more dialogue.
I dont get the show. They threw out so much great material and replaced it with poorly written shit like yennefers backstory. They could have adapted one short story per episode, make it 30 mins each and it would have been great. Now we have this confusing mess with 80 year time jumps every five minutes.<br>Personaly dont like henry in the roll, but thats purely based on his looks, he did a good job acting and in the fight scenes.<br><br><br>And jesus christ what is nilfgaard in this show? someone give them proper armor for the love of god.
imo they dont have to be a direct adaptation to be good, the books are different from the games and such the show is also different from the both. You should watch it if you like the witcher but if you want a better grasp of the lore like WitcherGeorge said, read the books and the games,<br>I really enjoyed it tbh played all games besides the first one and have read a few of the books and didn&#39;t find the differences to quench my enjoyment of the series. I was pleasantly surprised to what my expectations were originally of the series.
I have no knowledge of the book or games or anything just started watching the show. Id say it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs pretty entertaining and I liked the female characters and how they were developing, just some constructive criticism- your video for me was super repetitive. I totally respect your point but maybe try to express that in a more succinct.
I understand your concerns and I somewhat agree. I do think the pacing is way too fast. They should take more time with each character. It doesn&#39;t feel like a show that can replace GOT when it first started.
It&#39;s was nice the first time, but after rewatching with family members who went to bed at a reasonable hour made the blemishes of the show stick out.<br><br><br>On the topic of the video itself, I guess it&#39;s like comparing the Harry Potter books to the movies or that one series that never got off the ground called Era-. There&#39;s Lord of the Rings too. I&#39;m sure if I took the time to read all of Tolkien&#39;s books I&#39;d have a different opinion of the movies.<br><br><br>Anyways I look forward to the next season with the hope there&#39;s little more order and maybe a slower pace. Well not slowed down to the point where they start throwing in filler episodes, but keeping a bit more of the important tidbits.
Hey man, after the ending of game of thrones. I&#39;m honestly just happy it didn&#39;t suck.<br><br>EDIT: I do agree with you about the whole Doppler sub plot crap. Just straight filler
Nilfgaard is framed as bad because it&#39;s supposed to represent patriarchy, like their &quot;scrotum, dickhead armor&quot;. Intersectional feminism is cancer.
could not agree more. loved you attitude!
&quot; fuck &quot; - Geralt
It&#39;s still way better than the last few seasons of GoT... The siege sure is better and probably cost a couple of millions less <b>laughs</b>
A half-hour long dissertation on precisely how to define the phrase &quot;Letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.&quot;<br><br>Yea yea, that toothpick should have been in the right hand table not the left. And the Lord of the Rings in missing Tom Bombadil, the kids in GoT are too old, and metechlorians are whack.<br><br>Or you could just enjoy the adaptation for what it is, a way to draw normal people into a rich and wonderful fantasy world and gain more fans and more exposure for an IP you love.<br><br>Not if this guy has his way though.  Perfection in obscurity for the win.
As far as Yennefer, it makes a big difference to know where she came from.  It shows us why she doesn&#39;t believe anyone will ever love the person she really is. Without seeing this, viewers just see a beautiful woman and would find it hard to imagine her as deformed child. <br><br>Other changes, they always will do so. I think often they believe casual viewers will find the original story too confusing.  If you read GoT, the books are very different.  I just decided, after a while that as long as they are in the ballpark, I&#39;m happy.  They did attempt to cover many of the original stories, they held the characters tied by destiny to be the most important, and  proceeded in created an introduction season.  <br>As far as being &quot;inspired by,&quot; I&#39;ve seen &quot;Seventh Son&quot; and &quot;The Lightening Thief&quot;.  This is much closer in comparison. (I was so mad about &quot;Seventh Son,&quot; it&#39;s not funny.) Actually,  you might like that book series... Joseph Delaney is quite talented.<br>Anyway, I&#39;m not mad- except at that asshat who reviewed it but didn&#39;t actually watch even half the series.  <br>We all have opinions. We really should learn better to just acknowledge that it&#39;s ok to have them, and give each other a break.
Well done, mate ! Excellent  review , thanks !
If your gonna enjoy the show you gotta watch it understanding it is it&#39;s own adaptation.  If your gonna compare it to the books or games then it is gonna ruin it for you the viewer. People that haven&#39;t played the games or read the books will have no problems and won&#39;t care honestly.  Yeah it is different but isn&#39;t the author on board with this show as well? I think it is a good show overall. But I think CD projekt reds adaptation is the best.
My biggest issues with the show are the actress portraying Triss and the timeline jumps throughout the entire season.
It was decent<br>Great fights and atmosphere<br>I loved Henry as Geralt however,<br>a lot of cringe worthy moments and cheesy lines <br>pacing could be a lot better<br>please recast Triss<br>overall a 6.5 show, hope they improve for season 2.
I stopped watching at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=2m00s"">2:00</a>. Dude you made a classic mistake. That strongly affected your opinion about the show. You read/re-read the books, played/re-played games, dealt a lot with witcher source material recently. Never ever do this again =) <br>It is always the same story. It&#39;s how a human brain works. When persons plays/read/works his/her brain creates images in mind. A show/movie presents the brain with some different images. Because the images are not the same - the human brain does not like it. <br>In order to avoid it, a viewer need a time gap. Like serious time gap. A least 1 year since he/she had any access to source information. So don&#39;t do anything that is witcher related for 1 year. Then watch the show again. It&#39;s totally awesome :D
I was going to defend the show due to tv series limitations and that their focus was on all three characters hence the increased Yennefer focus. But I kinda agree after watching this review. Like they could have put in the Brokilon adventure into Geralt‚Äôs timeline, had Geralt and Jaskier actually fishing for food instead of looking for djinn and finding djinn and making Triss‚Äô survival up in the air at Sodden etc.
I thought it was ok (8/10) but then, I&#39;ve only played TW3 and haven&#39;t read any books. The guy that plays the Nilfgaurd commander or whatever doesn&#39;t look the part, and the scene I hated the most in this season is where they make Moussack run only to chase him down like 20 meters away, like wtf!?!? Should&#39;ve just killed him right there where they unloaded him.
I think when they refer to Nilfgard as being a backwater collection of villages, I really think they&#39;re trying to equate it with the Roman Empire. I mean any time you hear &#39;empire&#39;, Rome automatically comes to mind anyway. <br><br>Rome was founded by the brothers Romulus and Remus (supposedly), so it started out backwater. It grew and conquered all their neighbours, but it was the their spreading of &quot;civilization&quot; that made it so successful and I think the writers are trying to show those same similarities to the Nilfgardian Empire. <br><br>That may not be how it&#39;s portrayed in the book, but I&#39;ve always thought as Nilfgard as Rome so it&#39;s not a stretch for me.
All I can say is never read comic books.
Love your content man, and you&#39;re definitely allowed to dislike the show, however:<br><br>I find it really jarring when you keep stating differences between the show and books and categorising these differences as criticisms, this isn&#39;t a flaw - Flaws are derived from the quality in which something is done; sure, you can prefer the way it was done in the original source material compared to the adaption, but targeting the fact that it&#39;s <b>different</b> as the fundamental issue doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. I say this as someone who has also played the games and read the books.<br><br>In saying that, I totally agree there are some things that were done better in the books.
I‚Äôm so tired of fucking book snobs.. it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve heard all week. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the books and games too and am a very big A Song of Ice and Fire fan and had to go through this with G.O.T too... ‚Äú Waaaaa it‚Äôs not just like the source material!!!! Whyyyyyy!!!???‚Äù   ‚Äú in the books....in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books, in the books.‚Äù Annoying isn‚Äôt it!!?? Yeah it fucking is. Fuckin cry babies. Jesus Christ get the hell over it and yourselves...
I will never forgive that cringe Aard kiss.
I actually enjoyed the backstory of Yennefer a lot, because despite being an important character, she was completely overshadowed by Geralt and Cirilla in the books and never really given much character development at all apart from a few sections, &quot;mystery&quot; in my opinion doesn&#39;t count as character development unless the mystery is integral to certain parts of the plot and disgused for plot purposes, the books didn&#39;t do Yeneffer much justice despite being one of Geralt&#39;s main love interests, and she was kind of rendered a small side character, which undermines the whole theme of family a little bit considering Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer were supposed to be family in the core books. One of the reasons I liked the Witcher 3 so much, despite it not being canon at all is because Yeneffer not only played a much larger role, but also developed tremendously as character, in that respect I feel the games did a much better job with her than the books did. <br><br>I also disagree with the use of the word inaccurate, the show isn&#39;t a direct recreation, it&#39;s an adaptation which literally means a storyline that has been modified, I&#39;m not sure where in the books the show will plan to end or whether it will merge the storyline of the books and the games.
It&#39;s made for casual audiences and has the same problems like every Netflix original, forced cancer.
It sucks.<br>Not much badassery and monsters butchery. Too much boring romance conversation for one season. I don&#39;t want to relate emotionally to a character. I want to see the LORE, not a representation of real-life political diversity and an emotional train wreck of one character development. Like wtf? This is not even witcher. Who in the right mind would cast people of colour for a fantasy fiction that took place in norse mythology? Tbh I skipped a whole lot of minutes just to see the lore development. I think this series is made for thirsty casuals. <br>Netflix ruined it; Yenn, Triss, Fringilla, and need I say more about the changes they made with Yenn&#39;s backstory?<br>Perhaps they ran out of budget after casting HC.
I stumbled across your video. <br>I watched and really enjoyed the Netflix series and had zero knowledge of the source material. I knew it was a game that was based on books but that‚Äôs it.<br>I really appreciate your perspective and understand where you‚Äôre coming from. I love A Song of Ice and Fire and hated what they did with Game of Thrones when they ran out of source material. I found the books by loving the first season of the show, and have reread the series 3 times now.<br>Your thoughts and my experience with aSoIaF make me want to read the books and dive into this world. Thanks for giving me the nudge.
I agree with you that most if not all of their changes from the original stories were to the detriment of the show. If they had stuck to the stories better, the show would have been much better. However, they decided to feature Ciri and Yennefer equivalently with Geralt, which means they had to invent a lot of stuff about Yennefer and do a lot of time-switching with Ciri. That&#39;s not a decision I would have made -- I would have stuck to the stories and revealed Ciri and Yen slowly over time. But even with all the changes, I still really liked the show -- the actors were great (except Triss, what a wimp!), the world was believable, the dialog was usually good, the action/effects were riveting. So I give the show a 7 out of 10. Maybe an 8, if they didn&#39;t botch Brokilon so badly.
Not tryna be a dick but I have to point out a lot of the gripes you bring up have to do with them not doing a 1:1 adaption from the books which I don‚Äôt think an adaptation should do
Never read the books or playing the games, but I enjoyed the show. I bought Witcher 3 and am going to give that a go since I liked the show so much.
The only problem I have with your criticism is that you want the show to be EXACTLY like from the books. That would be just plain boring. I absolutely loved this first season, because they took their on take on The Witcher, and did a fantastic job at doing it. You expect the series to be exactly like the books on the dot and introduce nothing new. That seems to be me that you are not open to change and are quite closed minded.
For those who say that people are upset that it&#39;s not a 1:1 show and that it&#39;s an adaptation, there&#39;s some issues to that. <br><br>Pretty sure a lot of us get things will need to be changed and whatnot. The problem is, a good adaptation will keep the spirit of the source, essentially what made it enjoyable to begin with. An example would be a lot of the scenes in S2 with Olina in GoT, which were not in the book, but were very well done and kept the spirit of the source material to heart. A bad one neglects it, and inserts ham fisted dialogue and scenes. A lot of the adapted scenes are coming across as the latter and not the former.
i love this review man 100% but yenefer in cart is when she is escort baby nearly the same yenefer in the game. the rest is idk somehow so much different
Jeez, I get a lot of your criticisms but to say you can&#39;t bring yourself to enjoy it? Seems pretty dramatic, can&#39;t you step back enough to see it for what it is, a kind of free form imagining from within the world with interesting topics knitpicked and moulded to the likings of another.
The way I look at adaptations is that they&#39;re not the definitive version that will always be the book they are more of an alternate or parallel universe. Altered Carbon&#39;s netflix adaptation is a pretty good example of some drastic changes and tweaks like you mentioned but still being solid and compelling. But I do have to agree on some of the things being unnecessary uses of time in Netflix witcher but overall I liked it and am waited for the next season and also Altered Carbon. If you haven&#39;t read  Altered Carbon and if you&#39;re into cyberpunk scifi you ought to put the book next to Lord of the Rings for when you have time.
I feel like the first season of Witcher is for people who has no idea what Witcher is
As a normy who has only played Witcher 3, I loved almost everything about the show
I really like Henry Cavill as Geralt. but <b>I loved Yennifer&#39;s arc in this show</b> <br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m new, but yeah... I like itü§ó
I think with the going into depth with things that are only mentioned in passing is a good thing, we are told/implied say Yen was a hunchback and the fact that they elaborated it is fine.
Agreed.  Good show and good interpretation of Geralt himself but the story is kind of cheezy.
Good thing they changed it too, who would want a page by page re-tale of a story, that&#39;s always the problem with fanatics, they never want their precious to change, and fail to recognize it&#39;s for the better. Completely fails to mention the many cinematic attributes they went above and beyond with to reinforce the main ideas of the franchise, like destiny. People like you is why great shows like this start getting hate for no good reason, it always starts with an entitled fanatic thinking their opinion even has a right to shit on that which gave them a platform to begin with. not saying you cant shit talk the show, but to fail to mention any of the great things about it, and literally just start a bad seed, people like you read comments like this and think they succeeded, and that is why I kept typing for so long, destiny has a way of getting into peoples head one way or another, it could of been any other viewer, but it was me who saw this view hungry video and decide to comment, because by the look of your blind followers, I know someone needs to see this here<br>. Go and read the books and when season 2 comes out you&#39;&#39;ll be right back on for the views. Hope you get filthy rich!
I cannot believe you do not like this show I think you must be the only person that does not
I liked the show though I get your disappointment. The main annoyances for me was the portrayal of Cahir and the dragon episode. I got the feeling that because they had decided on bringing more focus on Ciri&#39;s and Yennefer&#39;s character development, they didn&#39;t have enough time to make it work properly. While I personally don&#39;t mind minor changes or some extra plot it did at times feel a bit half arsed. <br><br><br>It&#39;s a bit like Netflix&#39;s adaptation of Altered Carbon. If you haven&#39;t read the books it&#39;s a brilliant show. But because I&#39;ve read the books and I can see the changes they made I just ask myself &quot;Why?&quot; It&#39;s still a great show but why would you change it. If you have award winning material you can base it off of, isn&#39;t that pretty much proof that the source material is more than enough as it is?<br><br><br>I&#39;m not as invested in the witcher universe as you are. So while the changes annoyed me to a certain degree it&#39;s not a deal breaker for me. Not compared to the Star wars sequels where I quite literally got physically ill by whatever episode 8 was supposed to be. Never before have I rolled my eyes in a theatre. Not looking forwards to 9 in the slightest.
No sorry man I tried to give you chance but here it is, this review is dogshit and nothing more. Why? If I hadn&#39;t watched this show the only bad stuff I would know is the changes from the books but I don&#39;t want a video of what they changed from the books I wanted a review about the show, the fucking show not games or books the show and more then half of your video was spent on the books, I get you didn&#39;t like the changes from the books and that&#39;s fine but that tells me nothing on the show so apologise all you want this review fucking sucks not because you don&#39;t like the show but because this tells me nothing of the show and that is a problem please don&#39;t review the witcher anymore because this was the worst review I&#39;ve ever seen to this.
I&#39;ve only found this page after looking for stuff cause The Witcher is now out.<br>I have to say though that I&#39;m very impressed by your honest appraisal of what you watched.<br>I only know The Witcher from playing the 3td game, so I don&#39;t know any of the background or backstories at all.<br>Thanks for your video input here and I&#39;ll make sure I watch other stuff from you moving forward.
Completely agree with you. The scene where they are reunited again in book made me cry when I read it first. In the show it was like wtf they never met each other before, never bonded. Maybe if he yelled Ciris name, some pause, him turning around and then her running towards him would have a bigger impact. That was such a bs. Still enjoyed it and probably will watch next season but I&#39;m definitely disappointed and not gonna expect anything from now on. <br><br>PS. I used to laugh at polish &quot;gold dragon&quot;(especially when I was younger)  but right now for the time and money they had it wasn&#39;t that bad as Netflix&#39;s one :D
Really really well said. I agree with everything! I don&#39;t get why they erased so many particulars just to add useless/wrong stuff. Maybe the best thing to do was just choosing the most significant parts and respect the original story!
The way this review is framed as &quot;everything different is bad, everything faithful is good&quot; is a little petty if I&#39;m honest. Like this isn&#39;t actually a review, it&#39;s a list of what was changed for the adaptation without much reflection on how much they matter or what effect they have. It starts from the premise that changes are taken as a bad thing simply on the face of them, I guess just because as you say it is difficult to hold more than one version of events in your head at the same time?
I personally think that shows that change the show around, without knowing the context of the books beforehand, has been a good way for me to get into things. The show grabs my interest to read the books and the books end up being so much better that I&#39;m grateful for the show despite its shortcomings. Just my opinion though. Haven&#39;t watched or read the witcher YET, but I definitely will
You keep complaining about how the show is &quot;wrong&quot; but a lot of time you don&#39;t explain why that&#39;s a bad thing - so you just come off as a bit fan boyish. Almost no one cares if it&#39;s different to the books - if your evident deep knowledge of the source material can give us insights to actual problems with the show let us here them, it&#39;d be super interesting but this &quot;thing X is wrong&quot; attitude seems real unhelpful.
I love the show as a good stand alone to pull people into the world and series.  Its definately commendable to come in and discuss the things you disagreed with.  But would it not be fair to say that certain characters are inflated for the games from the books as well?  As far as the magic system and the source of magic... I definately feel the hurt on how it can affect other scenes in the future but to see the people in my life who have never been flung into the world before... to see their reaction to the hand and flowers withering was awesome.  The idea that magic users arent trusted much, and the thought that if this is the good and acceptable magic what is the forbidden and bad magic?  It all makes for a fun run and something new I get to talk to my people about.  The fact that my father has his switch (for pokemon because he isnt much of a gamer) and the witcher 3 port is now out... it&#39;s a very cool time to introduce him to my world a bit.  We loved watching GoT together and having another show that has a similar epic midevil fantasy political and magical feel is pretty fun.  <br><br>Something I really love about the show and the way it was put forth was the time lines.  I really felt they pushed this idea of destiny well.  With the beginning episodes spanning 30-90 years apart from each of the 3 characters arcs and then thay gap slowly closing until you are watching the same scenes but from a different perspective was really neat.  I am rewatching it again and having just watched episode 7 and 8 yesterday to rewatch episode 1 today was actually really really cool.  Even in 7 and 8 I felt like I knew something the characters didnt... and now watching episode 1 and 2 again it&#39;s even more entertaining knowing what is being whispered back and forth off camera. <br><br>All that said I agree that it is a bummer anytime characters and magic systems feel like they change.  But I really enjoyed it despite that and really really enjoyed watching as my GoT loving family members started to fall in love and feel empathy with a new (to them) fantasy world that I love.  It will open up a ton of conversation topics for car rides and phone calls in the future as at least 2 of them are starting the books now and 1 of them is starting the games.
i have read all the books played all the games i agree that the series and books/games are nothing alike but i like what they have done and like the possibilities the show can have..<br> i think they had to work with what they got the actors and adjust...<br> Ciri have learned nothing from her grandmother of what it shows with all the sward fighting Ciri could have learned at that age, and that her powers will explode when she uses them at that age she looks 22 but at that point in the story she should be a child..<br>yen should be a mystery as the story says i like the version they made but it is not the right thing to do..<br>Gerald has his flaws but i like him in the series he is awesome .... <br>i like the show with all changes it makes it more realistic and human witcher yen and Ciri is going to do good on screen i think but we will see.... <br>great video WitcherGeorge i like to hear a real witcher nerd/fans review and i like that you are NOT a bitch about not liking it and say it as you think it is thank you! for your opinion my dude
Honestly this is the best we witcher fans could get. There is no one who wants to make a tv show from this brilliant books. I dont want to wait till im 80 years old u know. They could do it better, i know that.  There is no need to hate a show for some mistakes.
Omg you apologize toooooo much.
There is no good or bad news, there is just news.
Dude, thank you
Read the books, played the games. Verdict: still like the show.
I see your criticisms of changes to the books. It really is just an adaptation. From reading lord of the rings, Harry Potter, Narnia, the hobbit, a song of fire and ice. This is how adaptations work. As someone who has read all the books, played all the games. I&#39;m happy. This is what I expected. And the fact they worked with Andrzej Sapkowski through the making of the show it works for me. The problem with comparing this show to a remake of starwars movies is that there has been no true good film adaptation of the witcher.
The writing for this season was done in consultation with the author. Yes, the author. The creator of The Witcher. Let that sink in, ‚ÄúWitcher‚Äù George.
WitcherGeorge <br>Today is the St Stephen day. The first martyr. Having an oppinion one is sure of is a bit like being a Catholic. Often hated today.<br>I admire people who are not afraid of expressing their oppinion even when stones are being thrown at them. <br>It requires strength. It makes us human.<br>And you do not even have to appologize for having an oppinion that is not shared by others. Why even should you? Even if in fact you might be wrong. Humanum errare est.
Yen&#39;s story is probably my fav part of the show.
Have read the books and completely agree with you on every point! To those who haven‚Äôt read the books and liked the Netflixshow, don‚Äôt get mad. Read the books instead ! You‚Äôre in for a treat;)
I think you should see it also from the series making side and the show runners point of view, especially when it comes to specific characters and the way they were introduced.
Very well said. I couldn&#39;t enjoy the show for the same reasons you listed here, and frankly, watching your review was almost therapeutic. If you ever feel like making a more detailed and nitpicky review, I&#39;ll be happy to watch it.
Your caveats are appreciated. I really enjoyed the show, but I suspect you are completely spot on when you say that those who haven&#39;t read the books will be in a better position to do so, as I haven&#39;t read them, but have experienced a similar dissatifaction from other adaptations of which I had read the source material but many the fans of the adaptation had not. Your review will not make me dislike the show, but it adds to the urge I feel to read the books, which i&#39;m sure as a fan you will be glad to spread the joy of. Perhaps I will get the best of all possible words, by experiencing it in this order. I have subscribed, and look forward to looking at your other material on the lore. Thanks for your honest input.
The high volume of breast made me stay and I ended up liking it to be honest. Except the shouldn‚Äôt have killed renfri... js
Personaly i thought the show was awsome. But story wise your are right. If people read the books it&#39;s obvious that alot  of the story has changed. I feel they did that because it was also to apeal to a broader audience. Easier to digest i guess.
My thoughts exactly.<br>Thanks for the video!
I feel like you are being very nitpicky with certain things instead of enjoying them. You are complaining that you got the entire backstory for yen?!?! Come on man... Lol you got extra and because of it you are taking points away from it? Who cares about the golden fucking dragon... Instead we got much deeper look into a much more important character and that&#39;s bad? Lol
I know where you are coming from. I experienced the same with The Lord of the Rings films. I knew those books backwards and forwards and was disappointed in many of the adaptation choices for the films. But ultimately I enjoyed the films anyway for what they were, one group&#39;s adaptation. Once the films were completed, I even came to prefer some of the changes to those in the books.<br><br>I don&#39;t know the Witcher lore nearly as well, having only played Witcher 3 and then only reading The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny afterwards, and only once, so while I recognized a good many changes, they didn&#39;t bother me nearly so much. And I quite enjoyed the series.<br><br>They always say &quot;the book is better&quot; with any film adaptation. Hopefully, you can find some enjoyment in this version.<br><br>I do agreed about Nilfgaard and Brokolon. Both should have been closer to the books.
I read the books, played the games multiple times and I actually enjoyed the show as it&#39;s own thing.<br>But you&#39;re right about all of this stuff, it was very irritating to me as well.<br>I mean like the episode 6 and 8 made me actually angry because they have really broken the lore soo many times, and if they will want to continue all the way through the book saga they&#39;re going to have a bad time.<br>Like for example the relationships (Geralt-Yennefer, Ciri-Geralt,etc.) were soo oversimplified that it has taken soo much depth from the stories which were presented this season.
Hey there, love your channel. I completely understand your opinion on the Netflix show. A lot of your complaints probably come down to the needs of adaptation; they changed <i>a lot</i> of stuff, but the stuff they changed was to make the narrative flow. Taking Ciri as an example, Geralt literally finds Ciri, abandons her, then finds her again. This cutting in narrative structure makes sense; you don&#39;t want to show 2 similar reunion episodes when one will do fine. <br><br>Some of your points, such as changes in the stories, are something I completely empathize with. I think they should have played a little more with the fairy tale nature of the books. I really can&#39;t strike against it though because, again, narrative structure for televised media really demands it. <br><br>This is definitely a case of the book and the adaptation going for different things. I personally enjoyed both when watching in this context.
the same thing has hapen with GoT, most peoplo who read the books didnt like the series.
I don&#39;t know. I commend your knowledge and I truly empathize with the way you feel about the final product, but you throw the word &quot;unnecessary&quot; around like you ALSO know how to make TV shows. And I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t.
It&#39;s just another adaptation that has been corrupted to push feminism.
All women have to be victims. Its the unwritten rule of todays entertainmwnt.
I despise the show. Simply because is forcefully dumbed down. Nothing has any internal logic. Setups, plots, events. And writters litteraly reverse every single detail. And it&#39;s very weird that I&#39;m not blowing this out of proportion. Scene by scene I&#39;d pick something that was change without apparent reason.
I really enjoyed the show, but after you mentioned that they changed a lot from the books I‚Äôve ordered them to read so I can experience the actual story
i&#39;ve read the books and thought the show did the best it could at adapting the books, if they kept everything the same as it was in the books the show wouldnt work
Ammmm yes I read books that have movie adaptation but ..... you are just REALLY nit picky ........ what you are doing is discarding the effort of actors. I know it&#39;s dump to change lore for no reason but still if you did not expect that you are just weird ..... in adaptations they change the &quot;source&quot; all the time..... still tho i will sub for the lore videos
It&#39;s a TV show!
I just watch it for Yennifer boobies ü§§ü§§ü§§
NetFlix presents THE NITPICKER starring WitcherGeorge as the nitpicker
Everyone in here acting like they are the best producers etc... Thinking the ones making the show don&#39;t have atleast the same amount of knownledge you have on the saga. Some things just work better on screen than they do on books vise versa. They probably filmed alot more scenes that might&#39;v had all the other points and things but it didn&#39;t fit the film setting.
Hey, witcher George! I would just like to say I&#39;m generally an avid witcher fan I got into the games at witcher 2 and then read every single book that has been published. I am currently doing my second read right now. although I may like the show more than you, I really have to say I agree with almost every single one of your criticisms and I am really anxious about the direction of the show. I feel the thing that makes the witcher special as a franchise is not really being showcased in this adaptation and a lot of the short stories are butchered to make room for ciri and yennefer. On top of that, some of the changes they make are so odd it has me wondering whether they are gonna follow the books at all. Not including ciri and Geralt&#39;s story in brokilon almost feels like a slap in the face when you see them hug at the end.  btw you gotta new subcriber!
Watched the entire Season already on Netflix.  I can say I like the show.  There were some rough edges that I&#39;m still trying to understand about the show.  But I find it interesting and am curious about next Season.  I wouldn&#39;t quite put the show up there with my beloved GOT yet.
Your woke
Fringilla is cringe and so is yenefer, plue emhyr is made radovid, redania is made nilfgaard wtf
First episode: some bad acting, clunky dialogue, poor characterisation and dumb fight scenes. The battle had no strategy, and half the deaths in the episode could have been avoided by wearing *helmets*. I don&#39;t get the hype. Maybe it gets better?
With Nilfguard I thought it was more framed as them being darker, but not evil. They‚Äôre on the opposing side, but we really saw some unsavory traits in Calanthe and I thought the show made everyone look shitty.
I think the writing for Yen in the shows, though invented, were some of the best parts of the show.
Never seen so many butt-hurt woke assholes dislike a video because they can&#39;t take criticism, It&#39;s a well thought out video with some insightful points, no need to get offended.<br><br>Personally I&#39;m getting tired of all the wokeness that&#39;s been leading up from one episode to another. I know you&#39;ve not mentioned this but the skin-colour / best actor excuse really bothers me. This is a world where discrimination is it&#39;s true intent on exploring how thing&#39;s have been shown and written in the books and games. Racism through skin colour would&#39;ve been more noticeable and much less accepted in a society of people that hate short people and pointy ears.<br><br>This is not a witcher universe, it doesn&#39;t feel like one and it shows in Laurene&#39;s statments about wanting to be &quot;inclusive&quot;. The actor&#39;s (Geralt and Dandelion) i though were really great, even though I thought that they already knew each other quite well when according to the timeline but It may just be me. Yennefer acts too immature and brash, 2 traits that don&#39;t make sense at all with someone who&#39;s been through a lot of abuse in their life, this girl just acts entitled and daring. The writing is completely off for me and the fact that Lauren says she&#39;s trying to keep the spirit of the books and lore while clearly pushing for some woke agenda is complete bullshit.
I understand where you&#39;re coming from, haven&#39;t read the books myself but can relate as in terms of my experience with Game of Thrones. I found myself having major issues with GoT from season 5 onwards because of everything they changed for the worse from the books (also have issues with seasons 2 because of this factor). It is hard to accept it when an adaptation is unnecessarily changing things which bring nothing to the story. I really enjoyed The Witcher season 1 but I totally relate to why you don&#39;t. Hope season 2 is better for you dude.
Your opinons were 99% like mine. So no, you arnt nitpicking
Overall I enjoyed the show and it was better than I expected it to be. But, of the few things I didn&#39;t like, there was waaay too much Yennefer. It&#39;s supposed to be The Witcher and I feel like we barely saw Geralt in most of the episodes. I was really excited after episode one because it was mostly him and Ciri. Then they added Yennefer to the story. While she wasn&#39;t bad, there was much more of her than the show needed.
I feel you man. Felt exactly the same. But I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re in the minority
I don&#39;t understand why these productions have to do time jumps. Almost every episode you have to figure out when something is happening. My philosophy is this; I should know what the character knows, and if the character is confused I understand that the viewer should be confused.
I definitely see where you come from. For me the show introduced me to a world that I could really enjoy.
Hey WitcherGeorge, too much apologize man. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that<br>s that, I hope we all know that by now. You should totally make a series of videos with how each of characters was changed by Netflix crew and how they where wrote in the books. Cheers
I disagree with a lot in your review but I found your video interesting!
I‚Äôm sorry bro but looking at how many times you say ‚Äúin the books‚Äù shows a huge bias. You were never going to be happy with any changes. Don‚Äôt expect an adaptation to not be an adaptation....
I completely understand your side.  I haven&#39;t read the books,  but I do agree that some stories were pointless,  and what makes a good story is actions that have consequences.  That being said though I do think some things were done well and for those that don&#39;t know what the wotcher even is,  it&#39;s important to introduce backstory to explain the world.
There were things I also didn‚Äôt like in the story, but to me it felt like the only criticism was just that it wasn‚Äôt the same as the book. I think if you just try to enjoy it for what it is instead of trying to compare it, you would be pleasantly surprised. It may not be a completely faithful adaptation, but I think it is pretty good in it‚Äôs own right. Also, you complained a lot that things were more developed in the book, and yea, Of course things will be more developed in a book. When you only have about 8 hours of screen time for an entire series you have to cut some character development out to make room for the plot development and action. Another comparison, a book has no budget for special effects they have to adhere to, can go into extreme detail due to the longevity of it and the fact that a scene a book costs next to nothing when compared with the cost of a scene in the tv show. It is simply unrealistic to expect everything to be as developed as in the book.
I can respect your views.  As someone who knew nothing about &quot;The Witcher&quot; other than a lot of people liked the video games, and that the game was based off the books, I went into the series blind.  Because I didn&#39;t have the background and what the stories were about, it was a level playing field.<br><br>What is drawing my unto it is how these characters are being played out.  I like that Garrad has a certain code he lives by, but is consistantly challenged on it.  I like that Gennifer is someone who learned how to manipulate and use her power, made a litterally life changing decission, and later regrets it.    <br><br>I can deffinatly relate to what you have problems with, though.  &quot;The Hobbit&quot; being a prime example, or &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  Even reading the books for the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; I got a lot more oit of.  Like Luke&#39;s relationship with Biggs.  What I did though, is stop comparing the various forms to each other, weighing them on their own merrit.  &quot;The Witcher&quot; swries was drawn me into that world, and now I want to get the games and play them, and pucknup the books and get into the literature. <br><br>But, that&#39;s just me.
i get where youre coming from, i love when media sticks to the source material. However, given its a tv show, to have any future as a series it needs to cater to a wider market. So while i often ebb on the side of wanting purist authenticity when it comes to adaptations, if you can appreciate the goals and hurdles of adapting it to television, you may appreciate what it does well more :-)
BIG fan of the Witcher games, have only recently started on the books, still on book 2. So the show isn&#39;t offending me with its inaccuracy, but I expect that will change as I read more.
Honestly, I couldn‚Äôt give a shit about the books. I love the game and I think the show is awesome. The only negative is that it‚Äôs only 8 episodes.
i think nilfgard is portrayed that way by the leaders of cintra to show the pridefullness of calanthe
was ciri not 15 when she met geralt in the books?!?!
I understand where you&#39;re coming from and agree with you to an extent however I think we as a Fandom should use this as a way to get more people into the video games and books I think the writer tried to make the show appeal to as many people as possible and if that&#39;s the case we should capitalize on this opportunity to make the witcher more popular and hopefully expand the universe and get something similar to the star wars universe where there are multiple books comics and maybe a movie one day we should accept as many people as possible into the Fandom and correct them not shun them away with this maybe we&#39;ll see a day where fantasy movies are as popular as comic book movies
Expectations for something new to be just like the old, will be bothering you for a long long time, and not just with this show.<br>I, for one, had no expecations, and i loved everything they did with the characters.<br>However, i don&#39;t judge you.......you must feel kind of how i felt with the last 3 Star Wars movies......
It is impossible to adapt a book to screen with a high level of accuracy and make an entertaining TV show. See Game of Thrones.<br><br>If the main issue anyone has is books vs show, you are losing right away, and you&#39;ll never like anything.
Wait what? The show never said that Nilfgaard rose to power because of Fringilla. its mentioned multiple times that it was because of Emhyr leading them and in fact I got the impression that Fringilla was the one indoctrinated by Nilfgaard and is now serving their interests over the brotherhood.
I totally agree with your review.<br>I felt the show was like an extended fan film and not a dedicated film production.
Dude your way too harsh on this show. They dont make changes to insult or piss off book fans, but to flesh out the lore more so they can tell a more detailed story and give characters more motives for doing something. Like the black mage going to the kingdom an leading them from the slums into a powerful threat invading all other kingdoms. This didnt happen in the books but is added on to build a better reason for them to invades and gives the show an antagonist while connecting the mages to her. If u watch the bts the show runners tell the reasons why somethings were changed to make better stories on screen and to make sense of it all. Plus things they added gave us more back story to charaters we didnt know much about like Yennefer, Ciri, Dandelion, the Mages and the overall world. Its building a world so the show can have more seasons without leaning so much on the books.
The only time I have been satisfied with adaptations is when they have been my introduction to the material that then leads me to the source. In point of fact I think that‚Äôs just the way it works naturally. You think the adaptations are for the fans and it seems logical, but the fans are always the ones disappointed in the adaptation and talk negatively about it, I‚Äôve come to realize adaptions are ways to bring new fans in who can then get interested and pick up the books and games not satisfy pre existing fans.
There is alot I didn&#39;t like in this TV series. <br>First there is so many people of color for no reason, black elfs, even a black man as a knight. <br>Every time I saw it, it took me out of the scene. Sure it is a fantasy, but still a fantasy based on medival ages. Was there ever a black skin knight? Most of europien countries haven&#39;t had colonies in Africa yet. It just looks silly. Black elf kid I got used to since this is &#39;magical creature&#39;, still bit odd. <br>Next is how non-slavic this series felt. <br>Noone have slavic look, race-bend all over the place, landscapes are very not-slavic. Mountians, oceans, while world of The Witcher is more or less based on topography of Poland. And as name suggests (Poland names origins in word &#39;pole&#39; -means field) we shoul see some more flat, rather humidity landscapes. <br>It all feel so american.<br>Human demographic is american, behaviour, even fighting scenes were american. Geralt clearly have a deathwish, uncovering his back everytime he strikes. Maybe it looks &#39;cool&#39; but is also dumb. Cool and dumb.<br>Too much made-up Ciri and Yen scenes. Many scenes with them serve no purpose, they are just to force push females into main roles. <br>As we are on topic of that, what is about all thet toxic femenin sexism? Calante saying what she will do if she only had a cock? Dialogue out of place, and pointless. <br>Way they show us Ciri make her waaaay OP, some dudes wanted to steal her horse. She goes into godmode and even that cringy dialogue that it was justified to fuckin kill them all for that, ugh. <br>I got some Mary Sue vibes here, Rey 2.0?<br>Let&#39;s not forget that DUMB Yen - dead baby conversation. Girl, if life is so bad, kill yourself. What was all that about?<br>Still there are things I enjoyed, mostly Geralt/Jaskier, but in some episodes Geralt felt more like secondary character in a show for some reason called &#39;The Witcher&#39;. Also what is with that Batman voice Geralt?<br>I&#39;m suprised to say that, but this tv series made me appreciate old Polish TV series more, with dumb rubber monsters, and painted green Driads.
Aw man your opinion is your own, and I agree with your assessments. Fear not the sugar booties, üòÇüëç
Speaking from someone who never read the books or played the games, I thought the show was excellent and the Yennefer storyline was my favorite. I am not sure I would have been as connected to her struggles without a properly fleshed out background. This whole video seems like a &#39;the book was way better than the movie&#39; sort of rant.....Which is fine but so cliche.
Do yourself a favor and listen to the lord of the rings trilogy on audiobook. This one is awesome, and best of all free lol<br><br><a href=""https://tokybook.com/lord-rings-audiobooks/"">https://tokybook.com/lord-rings-audiobooks/</a>
There as some feminist cringe but overall it was enjoyable. And yea, nitpicking
Well, i have played the games and read the books. And i actually enjoyed almost all of the show, so there goes that. Just to make clear that there&#39;s no such divide as &quot;newcomers love it, bookfans hate it because changes&quot;. It&#39;s not as simple as that.<br>That aside, there are a number of things i didn&#39;t like. First off is the way they treated Nilfgaard and Fringilla, portraying them as some sort of evil occult empire, which they just aren&#39;t. But you were wrong on one thing: the show didn&#39;t portray fringilla as being the reason for nilfgaards rise, but emhyr. Also: some of the lighting is way too clear and bright, especially in cintra interiors. Gives it a sterile and artificial look. They should really work on this.<br><br>Given that the saga develops the overarching world and political machinations a lot better that the short stories i am very exited to see how they bring the rest of the story to life. So far, there&#39;s plenty to like here, with also a number of things that need to be improved
I liked the show and this is a great review. Very accurate. I knew that the show was not going to be on point and i watched it with a different mind set and it worked for me. But its very true that the series is not on point or accurate.
at first i thought pavetta and ciri were the same actress with some cgi to make her look older... dang they looked so similar
WHHHHHY do people talk like fictional stories are &#39;real&#39;? &quot;This was wrong, this didn&#39;t happen like that ... blah blah blah ....&quot; hey guess what, The Witcher story isn&#39;t a real thing that actually happened. It&#39;s a story some guy made up and told in a bunch of books, later some other guys purchased the use of the license so they were legally allowed to take the stories / settings / characters etc from the books and use them however they want in a commercial computer game. And now someone has purchased the license to make up a tv show using the same characters / places etc. Judge the show on the usual criteria someone judges a tv show, allow all this stupid nonsense about &quot;this character is different from the books / game, this character didn&#39;t go here ... blah blah blah&quot; because that shit isn&#39;t actual proper critique, it‚Äôs just dumb bitching that the story you liked in one media wasn&#39;t copied across exactly when shown in a different media.
I agree with you that they changed so many things and I bothered with it also in first few episodes but then I realized they had to introduce characters like yen and others to viewers who haven&#39;t read books or played games and also they only had like eight episodes and so much work to do. I can see why they focused on yen&#39;s story line cause they wanted her to be main character just like Dany in got so they had to introduce her early and had to show what is happening with her. if yen only appeared with geralt for very short amount of time just like in books some people wouldn&#39;t have cared about her just like they cared about Dany in got. I can see why you dislike some aspects of show cause you know books and games you know how important yen is and who yen is but some don&#39;t know that and in this day and age people are very fast to judge character if you make her powerful without context some people will start to call her Mary Sue and shit like that if they don&#39;t know about her. And as far as I know got series it also not exactly same as books they also have altered few things in show so I think it&#39;s common thing to do. we can&#39;t criticize them cause Andrzej Sapkowski himself worked with them. I also didn&#39;t like some aspects of this show but I liked it I can&#39;t say it was bad it&#39;s just not up to witcher level but it&#39;s good at least for me and public reception is also good about show that means people who doesn&#39;t know about books and games liked it so they definitely did good in that regard.
I stopped listening about 1/3 of the way through. This isnt a review, this is someone just whining whenever X is not identical to the books. Not enjoyable to listen to. They are different mediums, nobody (in their right mind) should expect them to be identical, so whining whenever <b>something</b> is different is downright stupid.
No show or movie will be a 1 for 1 perfect translation of the source material.
Fair enough
as a conter argument i&#39;d like to point out i dont know any adaption that is as accurate as you would want
About the Nilfgaard one, so far we&#39;ve only been shown about the point of view of the Northern Kingdoms about Nilfgaard. Perhaps it&#39;s why they are portrayed as &#39;Evil&#39;. They probably will show more about the empire in later seasons.
I like the show. but I can totally understand you.
I tried and failed. I wanted to like it. It is a mess of epic proportions. Having zero knowledge of anything Witcher didn&#39;t help. It shouldn&#39;t be a prerequisite however. Think about anything ever made regarding this genre. It was some how understandable. Jumping time lines with little to no explanation finally made me turn it off after episode 4. Hard to believe it got picked up for a 2nd season. Far from epic indeed. Very far.
I&#39;m not gonna tell you to change your attitude or anything like that cause your opinions are your opinions and honestly I don&#39;t give a shit one way or another.<br>How you feel about something is one thing and how I feel about it is another. They don&#39;t need to be the same to be valid. Opinions are funny like that.<br>That being said, I watched your last video on the first episode as well as this one and  (I could be wrong mind you, but...) it seems that you came in already on the negative end of the spectrum on this show and the changes just put you over the top.<br>I don&#39;t know the lore as well as you. Would never claim to, but with my limited knowledge of the lore, the show was good. I enjoyed it.<br>We need to remember that the games had the luxury of being 100 or so hour epics that were able to use that time to fully integrate the lore of the books. A eight episode TV series doesn&#39;t really have that luxury.<br>Now you can argue that you already addressed that &#39;point&#39; and debunked it, but it&#39;s none the less true.<br>Expecting anywhere near 1 for 1 from a TV show is just setting yourself up for failure and disappointment.<br>If you look back at the show with tempered expectations knowing that it&#39;s impossible to get anywhere near 1 for 1 for the showrunners  and try to see that as not a failing of them but more of a limitation of the medium then I think you may find you are able to enjoy the series a lot more.<br>Hey if anything this gets a ton more people to look at your and my favorite series. <br>Win in my book.
I&#39;ve never have experienced witcher as game nor novel except for Gwent which makes me pretty much free from having &#39;prejudice&#39; on drama. To be frank I didn&#39;t like the drama. I didn&#39;t like the lack of info when it comes to Law of surprise even though I did vaguely understand what it meant as it goes but it was still poorly explained nonetheless. CGI was very poor despite the fact that the drama had spent more money than the first season of game of thrones. I liked the way how Yennifer and Geralt was portrayed but that pretty much was it. I also didn&#39;t like all these PC thing going on in the film. I&#39;m Korean but this whole diversity of race thing going on in middle age fantasy just doesn&#39;t work.
In Nilfgard, Mages were tools of emperors. Had no power over the ruler whatsoever and if they would have tried to get involved in politics they would be executed for treason. A good example of this approach to mages from books is Emhyr speaking with the mage looking for Ciri. Their purpose was to serve the empire - that was expected of them, as of any other citizen.
Director&#39;s license really sucks when making movies from novels and history! Part of this season felt like it was repeating itself, now I have to go through the whole thing again to find out what I missed.
I agree, but the show is even worse IMO...even for me who only played games, this show is a giant flop, it&#39;s just really poorly executed. It&#39;s like a parody.
I understand everything you said, but, in terms of entertainment, it is a show you can sit and watch and still feel joy for the art.
I played Witcher 3 and read the books and I enjoyed the show immensely! However, note that I came in nervous and with low expectations. Of all my experiences in watching screen versions of books, none of them were completely faithful, so I had no reason to expect that here. There were many things that they changed that I wish they didn&#39;t. But some of them were interesting enough for me that I want to know what they do with it.  I&#39;m able to appreciate other things related to film-making, not just the story aspect of it. I also am able to understand the limitations of film-making compared to writing down a story and all its lore in words at the pace of the reader, or compared to the interactive component of video games at the pace of the player. <br><br><br>FYI: LOTR - I loved the movies better than the books, Harry Potter  - I hated the movies, GOT - enjoyed both show and books (but let&#39;s not talk about that last season), Eragon - hated the movie, Warcraft - enjoyed both (game and movie), Assassin&#39;s Creed - meh. And many more things (not to mention manga to anime adaptations). I think your reaction is similar to my reaction with Harry Potter.  So I totally get how you feel and respect your reaction. Such a shame that you weren&#39;t able to enjoy it.
I like it always when things are different in a show/movie and a book series.When the writers of a show / movie take a book like a script it might be faithful to the source material but not as good as its own feature..To me a great example of this is the LoTR trilogy and the Harry Potter movies...Peter Jackson changed a lot of stuff but remained close to the spirit/essense of the written material and thus creating amazing stand alone films whereas the Potter movies were more faithful to the books but at the same time boring,generic and to me exist solely as a fan service to the books..I am not saying the Witcher series is perfect - it has its own cringe moments but nonetheless- as a fan of the books especially and ofc the games -  i liked the changes,embellishments and expanding on the lore .To me that kept things fresh and new and exciting  ;-)
Me when the video starts: &quot;oh... Seems like we disagree, well that&#39;s totally ok, he&#39;s perfectly within is right for his own opinion, and I respect that.&quot;<br><br>Me when the video ends: &quot;yeah so, fuck this guy.&quot;<br><br>Based on everything he said in this video, if he read the books before he played Witcher 3 he&#39;d probably think that Witcher 3 is one of the worst games of all time.<br><br>(I Read the books and played the games)
I didn&#39;t mind them doing Yen&#39;s story but a lot of what they did seemed very unnecessary, changing so much and adding things that weren&#39;t the case in the books. Especially when there are only eight episodes and they have cut so much. <br><br>Why not a shorter sequence of Yen becoming a mage, cutting most of the crap netflix made up and using that time to tell the brokilon story? <br><br>They could also have cut all the stuff they made up for Ciri and told the edge of the world story better. <br><br>Feels like they cared more about giving equal screen time to every character rather than accuracy.
Yen, Dandelion and Triss are major miscast<br>The director is more worried about making women look strong. Shocking
I liked the show.  BUT,<br><br>I&#39;ve played all the games, and read all the books.  Bring the nitpick!!!!<br><br>ESPECIALLY episode 5.  Watching that was painful.
why called it original series if they followed everything in the books? lol
I love the Witcher universe and had  hopes that the show would be at least 1/4 as good as Game of Thrones. Unfortunately i see bored with 5$ cheap contact lenses Gerald, ugly talentless actors, who ironically play the elves. I am not sure whose idea it was but they made the story plain and linear with poor attempt to get larger audience.  Introducing black actors  for race diversity in slavic mythology world, changing plot to make it a battle of good vs evil. I was very skeptical for Yen story, but I liked it and the actress  delivered her job well unlike the one portraiting Triss Merrigold. I am not surprised that the rating in just 6, even that is too high.
I dont know the lore hardly at all and I&#39;ve played the games a bit. so my opinion about it is basically just off the show itself of what I&#39;ve watched so far and I enjoy some parts but it doesnt explain some things very well just feels like its bouncing around
I would like to see an actual review of the show not comparing it to the &#39;source material&#39; I get that changes were made unnecessarily, and may have worsened the story. but why? Like I think all of the yennefer stuff was all boring. I was only interested in the beginning because I know she was important.
if you are too nitpicky then imagine Marvel Cinematic Universe
ididn&#39;t know read the books and the didn&#39;t play the games.... my problem was the sense of traveling and the cinematography of the show.
dunno what yto say man....i didnt play the game for me the wokeism ruines it. casting blacks just for the sake of diversity. i was and still am a huge warcraft fan and i have to say when i went to the movie  i didint believe anything could satisfy me. the story was wrong but i enjoyed the movie. i guess i m lucky i never played the witcher
My main issue with your video is that you do not know how to review something. You review a show based on the director / showrunner executed their vision of the script. Did they tell a cohesive story, was the technique in shooting good. Did the actors perform well etc. Your opinions aren&#39;t on the show your opinion is &quot;this is what I would do&quot;. You would have been better off doing a deep dive of what is different from the show and the books. The author of the books was a consultant on the show. These aren&#39;t a retelling of the books it is an adaptation. The games are also an adaptation and do not represent the books at all there are many many changes in the game v the book.
the  casting on fringilla and triss tho XD
If you read books you will almost always hate the shows or movies that&#39;s just the way it is as for this show I do enjoy it i have not read the books but have played  2 &amp; 3 I still play 3 and the show is not perfect but it&#39;s better than nothing I respect your opinion as you are a lore master I hope the show at some point will gain your confidence back and relief you of this burden keep up the good work man I&#39;ll keep watching
Why did they make Fringila dark skin? She‚Äôs from Toussaint. Another unnecessary change that doesn‚Äôt make sense
Wish there was more reviewing and less worrying about others opinions.
I will say this with the amazing source material the screenwriter is an amateur. They have sooo much to work with an instead the pacing is off and horrible. U have 8 episodes to introduce your characters and make it intresting instead they use boring cliche stories not apart of Witcher, I&#39;ve seen better side quests in Witcher games then the crap story written here. They made the characters stale not good dilogue at all, the  scenes in the games have good pacing and character. The screenwriter didn&#39;t want to make a Witcher show but her own version of it and that&#39;s the problem, CD project red are fans of the world and know what it is. The women screenwriter is just trying to get her own weird version which isnt even good to begin with
The show is a complete mess. I like Henry Cavill as Geralt and that&#39;s about it. All the creator of the show had to do was adapt the last wish for the screen and that would have been a good first season.<br>I would have put  each episode in order chronologically, that&#39;s the only thing that needed to be changed from the first two books. For me it was a real disappointment.
what i really think is that u wanted to see the book portrayed not an adaptation  but i understand like hell i wanted to see a copy of the books too but ...what can we do ? i enjoyed the adaptation because i wasnt expecting the books and that a reality ...for a show is amazing and the portrayals are very good but yeah ...we cannot expect an adaptation to be what we read already.
I dindt even play the game or read any of the books and i still loved the show
errr I&#39;m not sure if I want to keep up with the show after 3 episodes.. what happend to Geralt&#39;s eyes anyway üò∞
As someone who just started playing the games and reading the books, I thought the show had quite a few issues but was still good enough to watch, at least to me.<br><br>I have been spoiled by quite a few points in the story and have heard summaries and major points brought up and it seems a lot of important parts of the books were taken out of the show and a lot of parts were forced.<br><br>I, as someone unfamiliar with the series, found the show to have potential but have forced a lot of unnecessary parts and what probably needed more character development. The magic system is a bit janky and inconsistent. The characters from what I&#39;ve gathered are a bit off. Yennefer has a very child like look to her, and just seems child like as well. From what I&#39;m told Ciri is a good look a like, but she&#39;s a couple years too old. Henry Cavill seems like he is really trying and doing well but looks a bit silly at times.<br><br>Certain parts feel forced, like how (spoilers) Geralt falls madly in love with Yen super fast. His past feelings about Renfree make it seem like she was a past love, but they literally met and had sex once. Ciri and Geralt in the end straight up hug each other as if they were family, even tho they&#39;d never met once. Geralts has a super abrupt change from being against destiny and all forms of fate and then last minute wants his surprise child.<br><br>A lot of tell over show in certain moments when it should of been the other way around. I think the outfits were really bad at times, but it&#39;s only the first season and the person who did the outfit&#39;s is supposedly out.<br><br>The fight scenes and the way the story is being shown are great. Minus a couple of parts in the story, the way I have to figure out when and where everyone is in each episode is great. I like how a lot of characters were trained in this show and that Geralt isn&#39;t the only one doing cool stuff. The music and acting done by Jaskier or Dandelion were amazing.<br><br>Overall this show could do well in the long run. I think it has potential, but as long as they take the criticism well and work upon it they can do well.<br>At least that&#39;s my opinion.
I&#39;m sorry but I really hated the show. Boring, childish, fast-food feminism, awkward, trash cgi, smelly sjw political views, bad scriptwriting... I thought I&#39;d see a high quality series like Vikings, GOT, or Rome for example :(
Key word adaptation, and do are the the games a adaptation. I think the show ok so far. As long as I keep getting more things witcher your I&#39;m good. I been there for day one with the witcher one game, then read the books and i love it all
Honestly when it ended I wanted more and I didnt notice any plot hole or just outrageously bad acting. It was good and the writer supports it. Sorry purists it was good :)
The books will always be better, the games were also amazing. I feel like they tried to stay true to the source material but didn&#39;t entirely. But, I feel like they stayed close enough for the majority of fans to be satisfied. I personally really liked it, I think that the story will be given justice when all is said and done. Let&#39;s hope upcoming fantasy tv series hit The mark, The Wheel of Time and LOTR in particular!
Just found your page...books and shows enjoy both...this is coming from<br>The biggest GOT fan and once the books ran out so did the story.
if that is not nitpicking I don&#39;t know what is. you just try to find flaws in the show so you will have what to talk about. when you watch the show you just look for flaws instead of just enjoying it. and that is just sad....
@WitcherGeorge I really respect your point of view, freakin&#39; awesome review! One thing that happened to me after watching the series and your review, is that I got the interest to go to the books (although I&#39;m actually not a book reader lol), but I feel it will make me want even more to play the games (already played a little of witcher 3). What I&#39;m saying is basically that the series made me happy to see characters onscreen that I interacted in Witcher 3 and it made me more enthusiastic towards the original lore.<br>Anyway, again, awesome review, made me think a lot. Probably witcher will be my hobbie the next year lol!<br>Also, would very much love a nit picky version of the show too (:<br><br>Cheers and sorry for the bad english!
Who cares about the changes??!! It should be different than the books.
I Love the show, but I can see where you are coming from. I just started reading the books, and after reading about the whole encounter with the gold dragon, it feels watered down, and kind of fed to us in baby food form for the show. I like the encounter so much more in the book, because there was so much more depth to it, it was far more awesome, and made more sense. I have only gotten to like chapter 3 of the first book, and I already feel a little bit disappointed in a part of the show. That doesn&#39;t really bode well for me. <br><br>It also bothered me how they set one rule for magic, saying that all magic has a cost that it is so brutal that a woman hand withered from the effect of just lifting a small rock, then proceed through the show with 90% of the spells cast showing no cost at all. Can you imagine how much it should have cost for Yennifer To try to bind a djinn? Also the part at the end when they meet felt weird, because this was the first actual time they met and they were effectively strangers according to the show. Oh and Triss Marigold, didn&#39;t feel in any way like Triss at all. That character was a disappointment to me honestly. <br><br>That said, I still love the show, but I think I will have to consider it as something else, or maybe some sort of alternate timeline sort of deal, and maybe just glaze over some of the loopholes. There is a lot of stuff I enjoyed about the show, but not much of it was because of a witcher fan, as much of just enjoying it as it&#39;s own thing. I might be a bit biased though, because I am a big fan of the main actor. XD
I respect your opinion and hey i love your content. But your a shit reviewer. I&#39;ve read all the books and played all 3 games, you cant always adapt perfectly from a book to a show. I personally enjoyed the show allot. It was something new and fresh but also very familiar and true in its own ways. As someone who&#39;s read and played more than 3 times through,, the changes didnt bother that much at all, Im not saying its perfect but what the show achieved was really good in my eyes. you cant go into a show expecting things to go your way or wanting to see or find the flaws or differences. You just need to go into it with an open mind. And if you don&#39;t, your gonna ruin it for yourself
Do the nitpick, PLEASE
8 Minutes in and it seems like your contention with the show is that it isn&#39;t a 1:1 copy of the books.
I liked it, but I never red the books, I just played the Witcher 3.
I must say that I overall appreciated the Witcher Netflix adaptation. I‚Äôve read the books and played the games (except the first, should play it for the holidays), and I can‚Äôt get myself to hate the show. I walked into the show thinking that it would suck, but after watching it, I felt it could‚Äôve been so much worse. They‚Äôre are few things that I hated, like Cahir and Triss‚Äô repr√©sentation, CGI, the misadapted Brokilon storyline, and the Nilfgaard scrotum armor. But I fear I had more good moments than bad moments tbh. I mean, the actor play, for the most part, is incredible (looking particularly at Cavill‚Äôs Geralt and Jaskier), the swordplay and overall good transition from paper to screen. We all need to understand that it is not easy AT ALL to perfectly adapt a book on the screen, since the lecture of a book is different for every person on this planet. I think that most of people should look at the things Netflix managed (for once) to do correctly, and the visible effort that most of the cast and some producers made to represent our favorite characters. But it‚Äôs just my opinion, so feel free to reply to this comment.
Never played nor read the books but this show makes me want to read them. I really like the show so it sucks that they changed a lot from it.
I liked the show but I didn&#39;t like the way they pronounced certain words like Aedirn or Kaedwen.
Books stories aren&#39;t made for TV.  There&#39;s a certain amount of characters they can develop and things that a TV audience would want to see.  Also, aren&#39;t the games different from the books as well?  I think it&#39;s a fun show and anyone wanting an exact adaptation isn&#39;t realistic.
Honestly, thank you for doing your best for an objective point of view. I respeat the integrity. Jeep it up. I like what I see even in my drunken state and never seeing another one of your videos
I&#39;m glad we share the same opinion. The books are great and well-told whereas the show seemed rushed and patchy in parts.<br>I don&#39;t hate the show but i don&#39;t love it either. One thing i just think the sword fights are a bit strange they just seem even far fetched for the games..
So, you wanted a completely copied version of the books&#39; story...<br>That would have been boring, since we already know the story.
YEhniffer Henniffer ehnniffer Pepega Pepega Pepega full blown Pepega
Changing the story doesn&#39;t make it bad.
I feel like the series is very lacking in character development and relationships. The writers I think are just poor.
You haven&#39;t read The Lord of the Rings???!! You need to. It will change your life.
I liked the show a lot, here&#39;s a Like from me for your video. As another has said, there&#39;s no need to do damage control for expressing your opinion, especially one that&#39;s delivered so validly. There&#39;s a lot of stupid criticisms people have for disliking the show. Primarily, the reasons I&#39;ve seen are shallow garbage that could be summed up to &quot;there shouldn&#39;t be black and brown people in the world of The Witcher.&quot; On the other hand, you&#39;ve provided good and in-depth analysis of why you don&#39;t like specific changes that have to do with story and character development. Both the show and your review have me very interested in reading the source material.
I didn&#39;t expect much of the show, but I am enjoying. Very nice magic world. Loved Henry Cavill as Witcher.
So, you&#39;re going to watch next season anyway?  See, that, I don&#39;t get...I was a fan of the Expanse, and after seeing the extreme amount of changes to the story from the book to the show, I&#39;ve skipped it.  It&#39;s not that I think the show is bad, it&#39;s just not what I&#39;m  looking for.  I hadn&#39;t read the book before checking out the show, but I am now, because I want to understand the world, even deeper.  I played the games, but those seem to divert from the books in several different ways too.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=1m58s"">1:58</a> That is what I noticed with most critiques about the show&#39;s &quot;flaws&quot;. I read the Rotten Tomato reviews who seem to dislike it, they have the same opinion on the direction of the story, in the show, versus what the books told. They all emphasized on what was cut out or the story is not heading the same way as the book. However, the adaptation, in my opinion fit the format of the show. It is another medium and the story, plots and events will be changed due to how it will be communicated. Compared to the book or even the video games; they all have a different way of showing what is happening but they all got there on a similar manner.<br>I also noticed that the Netflix adaptation reminds me of the Netflix Castlevania anime; especially how some characters are introduced, their backstory and the progress of each episode.
For me I liked the series. I know it sucks for the book reader and for people who played the game. I am not a gamer nor a reader, I just enjoyed the show. I respect your opinion I would have the same reaction if I played or read the book. Kuddos beo
I found the series to be very entertaining as a fantasy series, but I have to agree with you with on the show.
Stop being so apologetic for having a contrarian opinion, dude. You don&#39;t need everyone to always like you. And people will respect you more for being firm about your opinion.
I really really like the show actually. Only thing i would like improved is the special effects. Game of thrones did the special effects Way better but i like the World in the witcher better. I never played the games or read the book.
My only real problem is the change to the magic and mages. I actually enjoyed the story of the show, maybe even some improvements from the books, but the changes to how the world itself works doesn‚Äôt make sense.
I wish I could disagree.
I liked your review George. From my point of view, this is a good tv show, considering we don`t have much good fantasy tv shows. However, this is a terrible adaptation of the original Witcher lore itself.
Expectations need to be lowered when a movie or TV show has been adapted from a book.  Hollywood rarely follows the source material.  LotR is a good example, along with the Hobbit.  The movies are just shadows of the books, however I enjoyed them both.  Another good example would be the movie Shooter which is based off the book Point of Impact.  I read that years before I saw the movie, and when I saw the movie it was quite different, but I recognized it enough to remember that I had read the book.  I look at  it like two different people telling the same story that was handed down from generation to generation.  Neither of them are going to tell exactly the same story.
I get that you are used to one thing and the set history and lore but my only question is ‚Äòis different bad?‚Äô It seems to me as an outside viewer that there is a large dislike with the justification being its different, even so good review üëç
They don‚Äôt have to follow the books exactly cause then if u read them there is no point watching the show. Also don‚Äôt forget that the game didn‚Äôt follow the books exactly and we all enjoyed it and even you made your channel based on that. In my opinion the game was the best then the books and the show. All of them have their own beauties.
Seems like a fair assessment of the show.<br><br>I&#39;m only 2 episodes in and as much as I want to like it, I already hate what they&#39;ve done to it, knowing what I do from the books and games.
Dispute a few design flaws from the show, I enjoyed the witcher show. I biggest thing that irritated me was Tris.
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Please do a nitpick and for god sake man - don&#39;t be so afraid to have an opinion. People that would get angry with you for holding an opinion are not the ones to care about you having given a disclaimer in the first place. Thanks for the video.
This series just made his job irrelevant and flushed 2 years of hard work down the toilet but I think he was fair. I enjoyed the show but I know even for me it seamed like the was wasting it&#39;s potential and I haven&#39;t played the games or read the books now I know it did. This show could have been better than Game of Thrones if it had a honest fan at the helm or someone who sees the potential in something. Look this show dropped the ball  compared to  what it could have been. I like to state again I enjoyed the show and I will watch it again. now I  know why I enjoyed it but didn&#39;t love it.
Trying my damndest not to drop this show but its very confusing don&#39;t know who is who.  But Henry is killing it only reason I&#39;m still watching
Never read the books and the games have been in my steam backlog for a very long time but in the first episode I thought I had met my new favourite fantasy character, and she was just murdered like 20 mins later üòÇ
Recap- I‚Äôve dedicated my free time for years to Witcher lore and the Netflix version didn‚Äôt cater to that or me , therefore its not good.
I agree a lot with you, but I&#39;m glad they added all the magic school stuff. I think it really gives you anb idea how magic and politics works in this world and i can imagine something like this happening to all the sorceresses, which explains why so many of them in books are  so cold-hearted
I feel very hardcore fans never are happy with stuff like this. I honestly not throwing stones at u George, its just seems like a very common thing happens almost with every book to movie/tv franchise.<br><br>Personally I enjoy the show, but im not a hardcore fan. Ive played Witcher 3 3x times + the DLC. Ive almost read Last Wish. I will start playing Witcher 1 and 2 soon tho.<br><br>My question tho George is, will u watch Season 2?
I find it weird how people will dislike a show/movie because of things they changed from the source material. Like it&#39;s understandable if what&#39;s presented in the show is lackluster however I dont see how yennefer being given a backstory and nilfgaard only rising to power recently is a bad thing. Those things are different from the books but I dont see them as drastic/important changes and they dont hurt the story. And really they probably strengthen the story. TV is a different medium compared to books. I&#39;ve read Harry Potter like 5 times. And I see the differences between the books and movies but I dont hate them. They&#39;re just changes made because either the movie writers thought they&#39;d be better or they were necessary to be able to make the movie. They arent bad changes. So. It&#39;s really a weak argument to dislike something based solely on its differences from the source material. It borderline on being whiny and a fanboy type thing. &quot;Its not the exact same as what I love it&#39;s not good&quot; just appreciate the alternate take. If it was the exact same I&#39;d think itd be boring tbh.
Hey man you do you, i honestly feel a bit sad for you. I&#39;ve got this weird thing that I can suspend disbelief really easily. Makes me like stuff others think is bad. So if they say something, I am like: sure if they say so. I wish for you to be a little more like me in that respect. I litteraly love all star wars movies. (I do understand the I II III are bad movies, still love them though)
Well, let&#39;s start with the most important thing.<br>The fact is that this book is based on many Slavic legends (not just Polish but other Slavic nations). We know that Slavs usually have pale skin color, they should have got some actors from Eastern Europe. The story is not bad but not really good either. (mostly because the book is so great, and if you read it, you would know what I think). But English accent in the Slavic world?!!<br>I think the main actor is good, Ciri looks good too. Will see who will be once she gets an adult. Triss Merigold and Yenifer just failed. I was expecting Mila Jovovich as Yennifer. And do not get me started on figurants.<br>This actually feels like cultural appropriation of what are Slavic legends presented by non-Slavic people.
just bindged it start to finish. <br><br>as a man who hasn&#39;t read the books, it was great but i see your point. books are just better. you didn&#39;t need the 25 mins of this.
The actresses playing Triss and Yen are butters and should be re-casted
As someone who didn&#39;t read the books nor played the game , I really enjoyed the show, but now I&#39;m reading the books, I wonder if my mind will change ? ü§î
I am loving the show. I respect your opinion though.
I give it a 6.5/10.
I can&#39;t wait for R√≠an Johnson to direct season 2. He will create a new character Ciri&#39;s twin sister, she will kill Ciri, Geralt will go to exhile, make yennefer the Main villain and turn Vilgefortz a simple farmer.
I do remember when I first went to see LotR, Fellowship. I was and am a big fan of the books and when I saw that movie for the first time, a whole bunch of things didn&#39;t line up with the book or the characters weren&#39;t those I pictured in my head and had come to love and enjoy.<br>I had to go back to that movie 3 times before I could let go and say that the movie was inspired on, not LotR. <br>With that in mind, I didn&#39;t have problems with the Witcher. The problems and inconsistencies you point out are completely fair, but I would advise you to just see it as a show inspired on, not being the Witcher.
In my opinion they took the best momemts of first two books and just ruined them. No bond between Gerald and Ciri, bitchy and powerful Yennefer portraited as kind of crybaby and many other things. As a book reader, I tried to be openminded and I really wanted to enjoy the serie (especially after I&#39;ve seen Star wars in cinema), but sometimes it was almost painful for me to continue watching.
this series has been made base on assuming that everyone already know &#39;the witcher&#39;. overall it just a shit show for those fans who want to hear henry say &#39;lesser evil&#39;. passionate fans want the best so they complain but pathetic fans just want to swallow anything that has witcher name tag on. the different between human and pig i guess.
This show was, in two sentences:<br>Too much told where there was less to say. Too little told where there was much more to tell. <br>And, I mean, dialogues and storytelling weren‚Äôt the most interesting and entertaining, so to me it was even boring in some parts to watch it.
I really wished  Sapkowski had involved himself more as a consultant, like George R.R. Martin did  with  the producers of Game of thrones. It feels as if he was content enough with the show being made and literally decided to sit back just to be as surprised as everyone else despite having financial incentives not to do just that. It&#39;s like a different flavor of his mistake with CDPR. Like you said in the video, the show was inspired rather than based on the books and that really just puts into words why I was so saddened when I finished this season.
It&#39;s fine to have a negative opinion about a show but how about provide some analysis about the episodes other than &quot;iT wAs DiFfeReNT frOm tHe BOoKs&quot;. Even the author of the series was happy with the storytelling style of the show in an interview. There was never a chance of Netflix episode by episode adapting each short story of Sword of Destiny/Last Wish without any additional context/backstory. That would be confusing and provide little to no character development. This is not a real review of the show but a comparison between book and film.
George, The writers needed to dramatize alot of events in the books for tv audiences! Remember, they are targeting viewers who have never read the books or played the games. You must understand that CDPR and Netflix created there own vision based on the books! Its based on a point of view! You would only really know this by reading every single book and every single page created by Andrzej Sapkowski! I was able to seperate the events in the games and tv show while still enjoying the tv series. Once you understand that it is based on the writers view of the books,  you will enjoy the tv show alot beter.  Cant wait for season two! Great video!
I haven‚Äôt read the Witcher books yet, I‚Äôve looked into the stuff but haven‚Äôt had a chance to read them which I hope to change. As for the show, I think it‚Äôs a decent enough adaptation and I will never say no to more Witcher. I think Henry Cavill is a phenomenal Geralt, the actress whom plays Yennefer is fairly good, I agree on your points with Ciri and I‚Äôm not a fan at all of Triss‚Äô actress. <br><br>As for the differences from the books such as expanding on Yen‚Äôs backstory, I have a feeling that was the authors call as well as Netflix‚Äôs. I think he made the choice to add more onto her to give her as much screen time as Geralt. <br><br>Now I don‚Äôt think all of it was good, the whole girls to eels thing is odd and yeah Nilfgaard was bizarre but I‚Äôm hoping they turn that around and stick closer to the source material. <br><br>They probably wanted to make some alterations so that book readers would still get some surprises.
The issue here is that you live and breath witcher lore and in the end anything different will upset you. As a fan of the books and games, I can appreciate the differences and like for what it is. Is it a perfect translation from pages to screen? No, it is not but you gotta understand real-world issues like the budget. In the end, what matters is getting the general feeling the books were going for. You get the emotional impact of Gerald finding Ciri, you get the importance of the sacrifice that the mages did in the hill (more than the books &#39;cuz they just talk about it but not in detail). I like knowing more about Yen&#39;s past because is not in the books that don&#39;t make it worse. Got has this amazing scene were cat talks how she took care of john when he was sick and it was a very cool scene and it wasn&#39;t in the books or anything... did that make me hate that? No dude it was a great surprise, I like it when shows or movies add little stuff to have a bigger impact. Watching something that is EXACTLY the same can be boring, in the end, the writers and directors wanna tell the story the best way they can.
There Is none slavic culture left in this show ...thx multiculturalism .
Congratulations!! Nice point on view!!
Another issue I have is that the focus on destiny at least doubles from the books in such a way that it can&#39;t let other themes shine
the show is garbage and  insulting to the slavic culture   and mythology don&#39;t get me wrong i don&#39;t hate black people or the actors in the show they all did osom work but imagine making a show based on the african mythology and put bunch of white people in it
I&#39;ve watched the first 3 episodes and just can&#39;t get in to it. From a purely technical stand point. The writing is poor, the dialogue is often ham-fisted, a lot of the plot points don&#39;t make sense. Things keep changing, the behaviour of portholes for example, or the rules of magic. Characters often behave in unnatural ways. The editing choices also keep pulling me out of the story. It feels as if there was a few writers and they never properly read each other&#39;s revisions, so they ended up with weird incongruities. It really feels like a first draft script. The whole thing feels rushed. Spending a bit more time on each step would have benefited the show a lot.
That being said, a lot of the lore nuts (I‚Äôm one too) went into the series with a negative mindset. Every trailer, actor/actress etc these people had issues with and I just think if people put that stuff behind them and had a more positive mindset towards the show they may like it more. The show was never meant to copy the books to a T but only to use some of it and mix it with what the writers wanted while trying to keep it as accurate as possible. That‚Äôs just my thoughts though, a lot of negativity towards the show well before it actually came out
yeah! just keep an open mind.
Maybe its just me. But i dont like the Indian Yen.
Some of the changes just don‚Äôt bother me as much as some others. I‚Äôve read the books and am a massive Witcher fan. Despite some of the annoying pointless chNges I can understand why some things are different than the books to an extent. But some of the changes just absolutely make no sense. That being said I do really like the show and I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôve read the books and know what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs not.
I can see why youre pissed, but call it an interpretation, not an adaptation. It is a different medium so changes must be made.
There are huge discrepancies between history written from the actual events.  Each having a different purpose and perspective. The books to you are the actual events.
I could only watch 8 minutes of your review (that&#39;s just because I ran out of time and I need to do stuff) and l although I do not share some of your views I think you did an excellent job of accurately portraying what the show is, what the show did and why you have objections in certain areas. Well done!
Meh, it would seem to me that you didn&#39;t like that it wasn&#39;t 1:1 comparison from page to screen. Which I can get, since I feel the same way about video game movies or shows. But I appreciate that you acknowledge it&#39;s a good show, just not what you imagined The Witcher would be, and therefore not your cup of tea.
The title should be: How the Netflix series should be exactly like the book.
I agree with you in most parts, but I still enjoyed very much the show.
was hoping for a show about a witcher hunting monsters and killing scum bags, instead i&#39;m watching two teenage girls find themselves...
the most i hate is the triss character i think its a miss cast the actress looks old to me
U are just sooo fking afraid of getting hate
I always try to separate shows and films that are inspired by established source material from it&#39;s original lore. I&#39;ve been let down too many times by most of these adaptations. That said, I did enjoy the show but did agree with most of the points brought up in this video
Dont apologize, you have your opinions and other people have theirs. Be straight forward and honest.
You don&#39;t need to explain yourself.. as far as I&#39;m concerned you are the arbiter of witcher lore.
If the male is prettier than the female leads, you have a problem. The actress playing Yennefer is pretty but she¬¥s supposed to be drop dead gorgeous, and Triss...what¬¥s wrong with a redhead? The diversity casting needs to stop. I still like the show, though.
TLDR; show is different than books hence I dislike it. IMHO show was great and all those backstories might not be there in the book but helped the audience like me who never read the books create an association with the characters
I thunk it‚Äôs healthy to have ppl not like a show I love. Just means it can only get better
The casting is bad. The characters like Triss Merigold, Fringilla Vigo, and Ciri don‚Äôt really look like how they are described in the books. The writing on the show is bland. With the amount of viewers they knew they could get for this show, they should‚Äôve put more effort into this show. I‚Äôm probably going to get ripped on in the comments for putting this here, so let her rip.
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23True"">#True</a>
Seems like half the video is an apology for your opinion. seems very weird. I Disagree with your opinion but didnt dislike your thoughts on the show because of it ,so the whole making an apology for your opinion seem strange.
I think the tv series is ok. But is absolutely horrendous compared to what it could have been if they had just kept with the original material and not being a bunch of sjw&#39;s.
I nearly had a conniption fit at the beginning of the episode with Foltest &amp; the striga when Geralt says &quot;point me to Temeria.&quot; Apparently Geralt has never been there, or even HEARD of it, even after spending decades traveling all over the world (and the northern kingdoms in particular)? He somehow doesn&#39;t even know where Temeria is despite being close enough to it that he can just head ON FOOT in the general direction the guy points in and arrive there in the space of a scene transition? They make it sound like Temeria is just some rinkydink village just down the road and not an entire kingdom. <br>There were definitely a lot of things I liked about the show, but I felt like I had to work damn hard to focus on them when there are so many moments like this that just throw all the logic and structure of the witcher world out the window for no apparent reason. How does that improve the show? Imagine Gandalf turning to some innkeep and asking where Gondor is, and then walking there in three seconds. He would look like an idiot, and Middle Earth would look like a joke. <br>Point me to Temeria, he says. Christ. I need a drink.
i think thats the point they make this show, not to make it same with the book so it will be fun to watch since there is no plot that viewers know about. imagine they follow strictly the book. from A to Z. pointless show with no STORY PLOT since we just see the translation to Visual story telling.
The show is decent which means watchable. It¬¥s no Game of Thrones in terms of direction, it doesn¬¥t even reach the knees of the very much hated Season 8, GoT was just on a different level in terms of production, filming and even acting.<br><br>It showed some promise, but some unexplained scenery switches, weird plot gaps and the camera work is at times amateurish. They really should have spent more time watching GoT and LotR.
I have done the first few books and played the games, I played wild hunt through 4 times. I loved the series definitely some flaws but it was better than I thought it was going to be considering the first two books were short stories I think they did a good job, I dislike the actor that plays triss but shes not in the books much, I think geralt Jaskier yen and ciri smashed it. And I personally think if they copied  the story 100% you would have still hated on it you went into it wanting too they definitely got the &quot;basics&quot; of the stories in the episodes. I enjoyed the games books and the first season.
I doubt an adaptation will ever be perfectly aligned with the source material unless the original writer is making the adaptation and is also skilled in the form of media they&#39;re using.  A good writer isn&#39;t necessarily a good director.  There are some details they got wrong, but theres also a whole boatload of things they got right.  As for the stuff that&#39;s not in the books I presumed they were providing history for the various characters and filling I  gaps in the narrative, which is pretty cool.  Whether or not yennefers backstory is in the books doesn&#39;t take away from how well done it was in the show.  I could imagine having been combing every morsel of witcher fiction for years now, you&#39;re probably &quot;in too deep&quot; as they would say.  This show succeeding gives hope for other peculiar fiction that may never get a shot otherwise.  I mean hell, it could be the original witcher tv show after all lol.
They should hire people like you as advisors for adaptations like these!
So tv-serie developing backstory is wrong, but videogame developing backstory is right. ok.
Please make detailed video about all things that was changed from the books üìö
But is it better than hexer?
You said the word wrong a lot, like if this was a documentary. Adaptations are never like the source material, because they&#39;re adaptations.
please do a nitpicky version Im sure I`ve missed more changes in my frustration and  I would like to hear them from you
OK, I&#39;ll definitely watch your video later, but now I&#39;m pissed. When I read the books, when I got to the part where Geralt met Ciri, when he told her she&#39;s something more, I got freaking chills. But when I saw it on the show, I don&#39;t feel no shit. I don&#39;t get it why the show is getting positive reviews, I&#39;ll definitely rate it incredibly shitty, because it destroyed the chance of Witcher becoming as good as GoT.
Dude I agree with all ur points and I feel the same about the show. Especially being a long time fan of the games and then the books
I&#39;m not familiar with the Witcher books or games. Just started watching on Netflix.  I&#39;m a little confused because they seem to be jumping around with time frames. They don&#39;t point these out and makes it hard to follow.<br>Is this a correct assumption or am I missing something?
As someone that is completely unfamiliar with the Witcher universe I found this series really interesting and well produced: the time line, the action scenes the character development all worked for me. <br>Any area not described fully in this series aren&#39;t a problem because it&#39;s the kind of thing gets further developed as more series are produced - it&#39;s kind of extra to the story so not necessary to dump however many book and game loads of exposition on everyone with in the first season. <br><br>From what people are saying the main issue is that it&#39;s not faithful to the prior depictions of it . . . I think a TV series could never communicate the world with enough detail to stand up to a book so its best that it&#39;s its own thing.<br><br><br><br>Really excited to read the books/play the game that vets think are even better then this amazing series :)
I actually speed read the books before the show came out and was confused when I didn‚Äôt recognize a few of the plots and stories. Your video cleared that right up. And don‚Äôt feel bad about having a passionate opinion. I think your points were all valid and thoughtful. As for the show I‚Äôll just take it as a separate lore from the canon. Not a bad show as you said, and I think Henry makes an awesome geralt so at least there‚Äôs that.
maybe you should review it as you have done well, but also review it as an adaptation and different continuity away from the books. How did the plot, characters chemistry with each other/emotion weight, pacing, sfx, acting, set, costumes, fight scenes, episodic consistency, cinematography creating or breaking immersion in the world, - work stand alone.  :-)
This show sucked cock haha! don&#39;t apologize to crazy people.
You‚Äôre just as entitled to what you like and not like as anyone else, dude. Don‚Äôt apologize for it. Your points should be seen as constructive criticism for a show which missed the mark. You‚Äôre not like the peeps from EW who reviewed the series not even watching it. You‚Äôre a fan. You are disappointed. You have reasons. And those reasons are more valid than those others have for liking the show. <br><br>No worries. Cheers, man. Merry Christmas :)
Hey, don&#39;t apologize for your opinion, it&#39;s just that: an opinion. I really liked the show (mostly for how they used time as a resource to tell the story) and I get why you didn&#39;t like it, as you said The Witcher has a whole other meaning in your life. Honestly some of the stuff you said would&#39;ve made the show better imo and overall is very refreshing getting a real Witcher fan&#39;s opinion. I really look forward to reading the books &lt;3
6/10. Henry as Geralt and Jaskier saved it. Otherwise it would be woke blackwashed garbage.
Look up the writer&#39;s room drama. The group of writers said they wanted to make the Nilfguardians look like dickheads... literaly, thus the dick shaped heads and scrotum like armour. With priorities like those, what can be expected.
Pretty much all book fans don‚Äôt like the show because it‚Äôs not the books beat-by-beat in its adaptation, which no TV Show/Movie has ever done in history so I don‚Äôt know why that was your expectation. Even Lord of the Rings changed/omitted things and is still held up as pretty much the gold standard for book adaptations. You have to judge it for what it is, not by how much is it like the book.
I have only read the books and love the changes they made in the tv show.
Black people in Welsh lore........very satisfying!!
I loved the show and I respect your opinion I‚Äôm a video game Witcher fan and I haven‚Äôt read the books and I wanted to watch a fantasy show and support Henry cavill
I had problems with the show, yeah, but it was still very entertaining.  And I loved Netflix and Cavill for bringing this great story into the modern zeitgeist despite the changes.  Also &quot;Oh valley of plenty is awesome&quot;!
I&#39;ve practically lived the first two books since my childhood and finished the rest of them recently, so it&#39;s still quite vivid in my memory, and I love watching all of your videos about witcher lore and.... I was horrified when I watched the show... I mean... I didn&#39;t have any high hopes from the moment I saw the first photos, but I thought: &quot;Hey, I shouldn&#39;t judge a book by its cover either.&quot; but..... The way they practically destroyed some of the stories that I read like 50 times over... And... some things were just anti-logical, like Fringilla in Arethusa (sorry, this is the spelling in Czech books, I know that it&#39;s different in English books, but I don&#39;t remember the English spelling), or Cahir shooting an arrow from over a hill far from a battlefield. Wouldn&#39;t it be more logical if he was IN the battle WITH his soldiers? Also why was he talking about a prophecy he was not supposed to know about? If I remember correctly, he was given an order to capture Ciri but he was never involved in planning or plotting.... basically only people talking about the prophecy in the books, beside the emperor himself, were the sorceresses. Everyone thought that Emhyr wants to marry Ciri just so he could add Cintra to his lands and prevent the inhabitants from resistance, and as far as I read, Cahir had his orders and never said that he asked about them or actually knew more. But what struck me by far the most was queen Calanth√©&#39;s attitude... Aside from her wearing armour on the feast and acting like she was obviously bored... Was she really making fun of those Nilfgaardians during the feast? What...? I was seriously wondering if the script writers are just kidding or if they are.... I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t imagine a single reason why anyone would write the queen making fun of delegates, envoys, ambassadors or whatever they were, from a foreign kingdom - however large or small, weak or terrifying.
series is so bad and boring just dont do it
Copying everything from a book is never  a good idea. It sounds like you just wanted them to take all of the things from the book and put it on the screen. But I think it is better that they changed some things for us who hasn&#39;t read the books, so we can get a better grasp of the story and a little bit of the lore. If you want the story to be your way and to have the characters look your way, then the books are a much better option. Anyways, this was your video and your opinions, just thought I&#39;d say this.
Why dont you cry some more?
This was already a very nitpicky video
Good things about Netflix‚Äôs Witcher: geralt, dandelion and ciri <br><br>Bad things: unnecessary diversity and poorly thought out plots
I think the show is alright, but the changes they made either really confuses me, or makes me groan, as the Dick armor, the blatantly wrong interpretation of Foltest, and the whole business with Cahir really put me out of the story
I quiet liked the Show even if they changed a lot.<br>Mainly because that&#39;s what to be expected. The way I see it it&#39;s another canon. I know it is annoying at some points but I try to judge it on it&#39;s own merrits.<br>And I hold the opinion that those who dislike the show should also dislike the games. because the tone of the whole thing is completly diffrent and in terms of tone the show is actually closer to the short storys.<br>I myself like all three things (books, games, show) al as their onw things that are very loosely connected.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=16m46s"">16:46</a> thats why it is based on the books, not copied...
This series is pretty ridiculous. reminds me of hercules or xena.
Just like Game of Thrones the book readers will never be happy
Just like Game of Thrones the book readers will never be happy
litteraly all I hear here is: I didn&#39;t like the series because it can&#39;t be different from the books and games. Please just let the series be its own thing. I don&#39;t think people are waiting for a visual representation of what they have already read. It needs to change things in order to stay interesting.
You right, The Witcher Netflix show, is absolute crap. And we all know that, but not all have guts to admit it.
Get üëè <i>W O K E</i> üëè<br>Goüëè  <b>B R O K E</b> üëè
I like it as an adaptation. It‚Äôs a new addition.
Make the video please, I feel I&#39;m alone in saying it&#39;s a bad adaptation.
Nope. You are just nitpicking and biased. I win. Bye bye.
The changes with Dandelion bewilder me. His character is basically reduced to a stereotype, they insert him into stories where he didn&#39;t appear in the books, and they portray their friendship so poorly for some reason that I don&#39;t get. <br><br>Geralt is reduced to a caricature too, he&#39;s missing all of the nuanced traits and behaviors that made him so intriguing in the books. His philosophical duel with Filavandrel was one of the best parts of the first book for me. His fatalistic world view, his sarcasm, his dry humor, and his care for Dandelion all made him a much deeper character. <br><br>All the things with Ciri and Yennefers stories is just bungled and messed up or unnecessary. They change SO many details for seemingly no reason, to the point where it is a spark notes of each story from the book. <br><br>All in all it&#39;s not awful but it could have been so much better
Personally I really enjoyed the show, even though I agree with you to some degree. The Ciri - Brokilon thing in the show was just bad imo. As you said, it didn‚Äôt provide anything to the story and that time could‚Äôve been used a lot better. And again as you said, the Nilfgaards being portrayed as the bad guys is something I didn‚Äôt like. And I think the bond between the three isn‚Äòt quite as strong as it should be after 1 Season. BUT I don‚Äôt think that a show has to be 1-1 like the books. For example I think the battle of Sodden was a great part. I want a show to add new Scenes, change existing parts etc. So I don‚Äôt think there is a right or wrong. However if a part of the Story is just useless, like Ciri being in Brokilon, that is something i hate. But for me a show can portrait and develop its characters in an own way. So with that said, I like Yennefers story and Henry Cavill played an amazing Witcher. Dandelion added a lot for me and so did the scenes with Calanthe.
I just don&#39;t know why, I hate comparing I go game of thrones but the first few seasons of GOT stuck to source material mostly and it turned out fucking great, as soon as he book material ended the show turned into a shit fest. What I&#39;m trying to say is had they stuck to the already great material in the book it would&#39;ve been better. Writers have this syndrome where they feel like they MUST change stuff to make it interesting.
I didn&#39;t dislike the series. I enjoyed it, I don&#39;t think it could ever live up to the game / books. Hopefully since Netflix put them on for another season. Next season will be better and more financially funded for better armor haha. All they need to do is stay true to the books, that&#39;s how Game of Thrones succeeded... Until it didn&#39;t.
The show isn‚Äôt implying Fringilla was the reason for Nilfgards rise. It‚Äôs implying that Emhyr was.
I can understand why you didnt enjoy the show, its not the books and some people will be bothered by the changes. They did warn us before the show came out it was based on the books but would be its own thing, so long as they hit the main story beats its fine as far as I am concerned. For me it if it was just a retelling of the books it would be boring as we would know exactly what was happening, hopefully it will push more people to read the books and play the games (but again, the game changes some things a little and some stuff alot).
I liked watching the show. I didn&#39;t read the books, I played the game a bit. I still respect your opinion
Outside of a couple of valid complaints this reminds me of those anal retentive GoT bookreaders who complained about Robb being a POV character etc. Didn&#39;t matter that it added to the show, just the fact it was different or &quot;incorrect&quot; was enough for it to be bad
I think we shouldn‚Äôt compare the show with the book or the games, the show has his specific way of telling the story as a show not as the books, of course there has to be differences between the show and the books, but these changes, I believe will be add more excitement for the show.<br><br>We saw GOT and loved it eventhough there are differences between the show and the books‚Äî ‚Äú of course except the session finale :(  ‚Äú.<br><br>For me, I didn‚Äôt read the books or played the games and I enjoyed watching the show, the showrunners are doing excellent job ( we can see that from the storytelling ).
I read the books, and i understand your opinion.<br>Some things bother me like the actor of Triss or the changes of Vilgeforz... and of course some of the story changes.<br>But still I can enjoy the Show, it&#39;s fun to watch. <br>I recommend everyone to read the books.
sounds like you need a better job lol
Just curious if you ever considered doing summaries of the books? I know you generally do more focused videos on one aspect of the lore, but I personally would love a refresher for some of the earlier books as I get back to reading the later novels. Just an idea, obviously it makes sense if it doesn&#39;t really fit with what you want to do with the channel. Cheers
The golden dragon story was one of my favorite. So I was excited to watch it and kept telling my friends about a golden dragon episode. And then I was disappointed because I imagined things differently. The golden dragon was small, the area/cave, old borch, the mini trail... I don‚Äôt know it did not feel right but it was still okay. The forest and the hallucinations could have been developed a bit more. The striga, dragon and the ‚Äúdeovel‚Äù coulda looked much better. Seeing the fight at Soden was cool. I am currently reading the third book btw... I liked your critique and keep it up man!
I really liked the yennifer backstory. I did not think she was a very interetsting character in the books. Here she is seeming much less one dimensional already. Happy im able to separate the books from the show. Its better to see it as a seperate story instead of constantly thinking about the books when watching. Its not a book its going to be different for reasons you may think seem pointless but there may be perfectly good reasons for them you dont know about or understand. Making film is not as easy as writing a book is and there is lots of untold reasons for most changes. If you literally copy books you will have a bad series or film. Imagine if they had did the first seasons of GoT like that (not the later ones they are shit) it would be unwatchable. Having read the books does not make it impossible to like the show at all. I would had probably dismissed it as a generic fantasy show had i not read them.
For me, I liked the adaptations from the books because it was cool for me to see a screen version of something I read and the stories were recognizable enough.
Don&#39;t agree with you about everything but you certainly echo my own feelings about Cahir. How on earth are they going to redeem him later on?
I didn&#39;t like some of the casting and the nilfgaardian armor other than that I like it
loved witcher 3, this show sucks
I really didn&#39;t like the portrayal of the Nilfgaardian Empire. Orc looking armor and weapons, it&#39;s just ridicilous. <br>They&#39;re just another kingdom who really likes the colour black!
GOD DAMN! George, I remember when I last visited your account, you had like 500 subscribers, I&#39;m so happy your channel has grown and you didnt give up, from last I remember, you had monetization issues, is it solved now? Did you do a face reveal?! Do one for the 100k subs mate.
Summary of this review: they did things that aren&#39;t in the books and they are wrong, worst review. Every tv show from a book are vastly different.
&quot;Incorrect&quot; &quot;inaccurate&quot; you just want a page by page adaptation of the books... lol
Man, understand, they can&#39;t make the same thing as the books, calm down, that would ve a copy and i wouldn&#39;t waste my time watching what I already know. There is no right or wrong way to do it. Maybe they make the series better and they becamr the new cannon ;)
Honestly I did like watching the series, but I do have alot of problems with the show, the actor  playing geralt I loved, but the split following alot of yens stuff I just didn&#39;t like, if there was just more focus on geralt, and ciri as well as ciri being younger aswell,<br>All these little changes mentioned in the video I agree with, the accuracy of the show or lack of it annoys me because while I did like watching it it just wasn&#39;t what I expected, I also had a couple cast problems with fringilla Vigo and triss, purely cus they don&#39;t really match descriptions from books or games, and the armour oh damn is some of them so bad, but yeah as much as I liked watching it there is so many problems
Henry and Joey are brilliant. The others, especially the screenwriter, have absolutely no idea what they are doing. If they had co-operated with CDPR this show would be a major success.
This is my favorite book series of all time. For me the tv show is a perfect adaptation especially pacing wise. All the content from the books is here except for unnecessary parts they cut out which i have no issue with. They show different timelines/origin stories of the 3 main characters that all come together. For example introducing the overarching plot with a short story in the same episode with the first episode. It keeps people interested and the depictions of characters are usually the same if not improved. If you don&#39;t like it fair enough but for me. This is my favorite show. Give a fucking coin to your witcher.
I‚Äôve been pretty invested in the lore of this fantasy world and I absolutely love it, and tbh I enjoyed the show I don‚Äôt think it was absolutely amazing (unlike the wither 3) I think it was a good adaptation. Except triss they fucked her up way to much and that pisses me off

The tv show is B grade bad fantasy... You were very soft on the critique I watch the whole thing and as a fan of the books and game it was painful to watch.
watched it twice over which really gave me some objective insight. first time watching as someone who has played all the games and not read any of the books, I was fanboying like crazy at every moment. second time watching I realised that there were several moments which really wasn&#39;t necessary to the story and excessive drawn out scenes actually made it boring and less hype. e.g. I got harry potter vibes from beginning of Yennifer ark which felt useless and unnecessary, a huge lack of fight scenes from Geralt, Ciri&#39;s story ark was unbelievably boring, the forest elves did nothing, and the doppler disappeared with no clarity. ultimately this entire season was a set up to season 2 and isn&#39;t a stand alone project. Namely only episode 1 had the best gritty/ bloody fight scene that was mouth watering. Other than that its pretty meh. Season 2 will hopefully improve on its weird convoluted timeline, increase fight scenes and decrease useless dialog. I suggest lovers re- watched the show and give it a thumbs up.
Thank you George! You speak my mind &lt;3 &lt;3 I want to add that I especially disliked the way Eyck was displayed and killed off.
Dude, I&#39;m from Brazil and wanted to say THANKS.<br><br>I&#39;m angry with the show and have found this video and loved. You talks about everything that I think
I honestly loved the show. The only real gripes I had with it were the constant and confusing time skips.
the books are different, the game is different, the show is different...yet the books, the game, and the show is great so far.. i dont mind the differences, thats what make each adapation unique.
wow never heard a better review ! man you&#39;re always spot on ! &lt;3
Make the nitpicky rant video brother
I understand what you mean. But I think you&#39;re forgetting that this isn&#39;t supposed to be a complete adaptation of the books. It&#39;s a story that&#39;s based on the books. Taking inspiration, not copying. Again. That&#39;s my opinion, I can understand why it would feel foreign and wrong to you.
I have mixed feelings about the show, although the only thing I was already familiar with was the Witcher 3, like a lot of people I imagine. Haven&#39;t read any of the books. I feel like the show got a lot wrong just from a world and character building perspective, it&#39;s also pretty incoherent in its narrative due to massive time-skips with every episode, and the dialogue is pretty cringey most of the time. Regardless, I thought it was okay, not terrible, but not great either. I&#39;m hoping season 2 starts to get things right where those areas are concerned. I&#39;d just like to point out that you&#39;re probably one of the few people I&#39;ve heard who is a fan of and familiar with the books that has said the show is inaccurate to the lore, I keep hearing about how faithful to the books the show is, but I&#39;m more inclined to take your word over theirs considering how invested in to this universe you are.
I was ok with the series even tho some changes were really weird as you mentioned, but the biggest difference of all is that without Temple of Melitele, Geralt&#39;s character is just missing something crucial.
&quot;I don&#39;t mean to nitpick...&quot; <b>proceeds to nitpick</b><br><br>First of all, you say you&#39;re being respectful, but you also say that the only people that can enjoy the show are those that don&#39;t know the lore and the books that the show is based on.<br><br>I&#39;ve been reading the books since they were in their Original Polish, been invested in the books since long before they became games (the games also changed a lot from the books, almost completely removing Geralt&#39;s relationship with Yennefer being the worst). So no, you&#39;re not talking about how you only disliked them because they changed things from the books. You&#39;re nitpicking for clickbait purposes.<br><br>Alterations to story and lore are bound to happen in adaptations, and if you like them or not, as you said, it&#39;s a matter of taste. But don&#39;t pretend that your dislike of it stems from some deeper understanding of the books and the lore. You disliked the changes that they made. Just leave it at that.
It just didn‚Äôt explain much... it didn‚Äôt go into detail about each character and the development of the characters (mainly yennefer) just seemed forced and rushed. Like idk much about how these characters came to be like geralt and his time at Kaer morhen or anything like that. I just wish it tools things at a slower pace. Like when geralt used his aard sign, no one who read the books or played the game knows wtf that is üòÇ. It didn‚Äôt go in depth and I think that‚Äôs what it needed especially for such a show. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the show and I‚Äôm ecstatic that it‚Äôs finally here just a few things I wish they did differently.
You are mistaken with some of the interpretations of details in the show. The brotherhood doesnt know shit about Emhyr, they were just being rude at Yen (the black guy is Fringilla&#39;s father) and making assumptions. The show itself tells us that what Nilfgard does is because of the White Flame, white flame is Emhyr.
They should hire this guy as a lore advisor
I played the witches 2 and 3 but I have never read the books and I only know the low through your videos and the games. I thought the show was alright, not great or terrible, just ok. Certain things felt very off to me and others were absolutely amazing. So yeah okay, I&#39;d watch a season two but it wouldn&#39;t break my heart if a second wasn&#39;t made.
I&#39;ve only played The Witcher 3 and haven&#39;t read any of the books. With that said I liked the show for what it was but I also didn&#39;t about all the changes they made compared to the books and the first two games.  I got to see certain scenarios that were mentioned in the W3 game. But now knowing that certain stuff in the show just flat out didn&#39;t happen, I understand why ppl wouldn&#39;t like it.
I disagree in that I really enjoyed the show and Henry Cavill&#39;s performance. That being said I enjoyed your video and agreed with many of your criticisms
Fuck you!!!  You prick!!!
Your mention of Lord of the Rings was interesting, because as I was watching season 1 I was reminded strongly of the LotR movies. It&#39;s a story loosely based on the books as told by some Hollywood types whose arrogance greatly exceeds their competence. The casting was mostly pretty bad, too. There were a whole bunch of times when I found myself thinking, &quot;They&#39;re not that kind of Dwarves, you idiots!&quot;
congratulations you played yourself.
You should really split this into two. One video review. One going into every detail that isn‚Äôt exactly like the book.
what is the name of the actress that takes ceri into her house in the last episode? She seems very familiar to me.?
It&#39;s okay to not like it and frankly, I expect probably 5% of major book fans to be even remotely interested in the TV series. Once we read a book and establish a world in our minds, it&#39;s very difficult to be pleased by someone else&#39;s view of that world. For what it is, I quite enjoyed the show and will continue to watch the seasons as they come. Ideally they keep coming with at least the quality of season 1 until geralt&#39;s story is over. Henry Cavill rocked it imo.
For me I‚Äôve known literally the bear minimum of the Witcher before watching the show. After finishing it and watching this video I can say the criticisms you put forward are valid. I‚Äôm a new fan of the Witcher and maybe that‚Äôs what makes me a lot more open to your opinions about the show. For me it was a great show, if a bit choppy at first with a few questionable things in some places, namely a stock scream sound effect over someone actually screaming, really rustled my jimmies. But now I‚Äôm very inclined to learn more about the Witcher and the world of it
It&#39;s the same, you wont like the film as much after you have read the lotr books. So good on you for watching and liking the films first haha.<br><br><br>PS<br><br>The eels were weird, and the whole brokilon thing without Geralt is so disappointing. But apart from that, i liked it overall. I didnt mind the new backstories they made for Yen.
I&#39;ve never read the books or played the games, so I came to the new show with a fresh attitude, and liked it a lot. I&#39;ve never expected a movie or TV series to slavishly follow the books they&#39;re based on...I think that&#39;s a way of setting yourself up for disappointment. I&#39;ll get around to reading the books and maybe playing the games eventually, but I think the series will add to my enjoyment, not take away from it.
I&#39;ve never really understood those people you seem so adamant to apologize to; if you&#39;ve enjoyed something, who cares what anybody else thinks? <br><br>I&#39;m kind of biased, because I&#39;m a sucker for fantasy stuff like this, but in the end I did enjoy it. The scenes with Dandelion/Jaskier managed to get a chuckle out of me on more than one occasion, I thought Cavill did a pretty respectable job as Geralt and some of the fight choreography was pretty good. <br><br>However I can totally see why purists would cringe at the unnecessary changes and rushed pacing and why critics would burn it in to the ground for it&#39;s confusing structure (doesn&#39;t help that most of these f&#39;ers don&#39;t age the way we&#39;re used to) and obvious lack of budget in some of the set pieces when comparing it to Game of Thrones. Some of the scenes felt sterile; clean clothes and teeth in a medieval town, what? A bit more budget on the make-up and some better (gritty) color grading could&#39;ve done miracles there, but I can understand it if that money went to the Striga fight instead. <br><br>I&#39;ve noticed there&#39;s some controversy on the discrepancy between user reviews and critic reviews, but I&#39;m kind of baffled between the discrepancy on how critics rated The Mandalorian vs. this. I think these series are pretty on par (they&#39;re both pretty much what Xena Warrior Princess was for my generation - and that was way worse). So maybe they should&#39;ve cast baby Yoda as Ciri to get that certified fresh tomato.
vilgafortz story wasn&#39;t changed he&#39;s evil and its shown at the end? Also, Vilgafortz was damaged thus causing him to lose since he didn&#39;t have enough magic to fight back
I completly agree with your opinion man... I am a huge books fan and i watched the first episode: cut short Renfri&#39;s story to show the fall of Cintra. different timeline? is that really Celante? Ciri doesnt knows Gerralt? battle and moments only spoken in the books are shown and badly too? thats not a show for me... To the people comparing with LotR i can only say this: LotR movies is where changes to adapt the source materials are done right and this series is where are done wrong.... simply as that (and yes I read LotR too)
I like sort of like and dislike the show.<br>I mean it is a Witcher show,and thats why i am watching <a href=""http://it.it/"">it.It</a> was fine,although as you explained in detail - Inaccurate,not true to source material.<br>I respect Henry Cavil for doing what he&#39;s doing,for his hard work,but sometimes it does feel like a waste of his talent on the show,the guy is trying his best and they go off make Fringila black,they add uneccesary characters and all this stupid crap.Nilfgaard costumes are a damn joke,and a disgrace,and they are just trying to portray them as Nazis basically.<br>But hey,some other stuff is good,the geralt-jaskir relationship as you said,geralt himself is good,other characters are there sort of aswell,decent enough.<br>CGI could use work,soundtrack is definetly inferior to both CDPR and the Witcher : Alzur&#39;s Legacy fan film.<br>Which brings me to this question,George,can you please watch the fanfilm and make a review about it ?<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GLtk2cLRu4&amp;t=5422s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GLtk2cLRu4&amp;t=5422s</a>
Agree with everything you said man, really don&#39;t understand those who can get so up in arms defending something they enjoy from critique! And the same goes for the people who go too far on the other side. Like you said, its all about opinion - some people love it, some people are gonna hate it, and everything in between and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that :) Like I said, great points and hope you&#39;re able to ignore any negativity, thanks for your hard work
Live action adaptions always change things. bit disapointing how much they changed but after BvS I think this is an amazing adaptation have to add some backstory sooner to this very mysterious series
Hey the truth is that you have your opinion and you are entitled to it, I&#39;m not going to judge you because of your opinion. I always enjoyed watching your videos and your work, you dig deep and what I would call beyond what normal people search for  giving us the smallest details from the books and gathering all the information to give it to the viewers.  Merry Christmas and take care.
I kinda like how magic plays a smaller role in the show, and that sorcerers are kinda evil.
Soooooooo,  You didn&#39;t like it because it didn&#39;t follow the books exactly. Got it. I didn&#39;t read the books, but i put significant time into Witcher 3, and i think the show is absolutely amazing.
I Think that what happened with Yenn is that they were trying to go with a show don&#39;t tell type of story telling for her since as you say some of the stuff is implied in the books. I like the show but I know that overall elements aren&#39;t fully consistent with the books. As many adaptations I take it as alternate timelines, I dunno like I disconnect it with the books.
Agree. But somehow, i ended up liking it. Above mediocre, not great or perfect. Too many contradictions lorewise and absurdity within world the show has established. But I hope that show will get better ‚Äî upwards is preferable to downwards (Game of thrones)
Do note that the series is BASED on the book, not a word- to word book adaptation. I enjoyed it except the abrupt timehops even though it looked nice in the end.
I hate to say it, but I enjoyed the old Tv series Hexer more than the Netflix one.
Gotta be honest, the first thing I did after watching the show is come to George and see his opinion, as all of my witcher information came from the Witcher 3, and WitcherGeorge channel as I never read the books.<br><br>Keeping in mind, I&#39;m watching an adaptation of a book, heavily inspired by a video game, restricted by runtime to introduce us to the HUGE world of the Witcher without confusing people, and the potential of not getting a second season.<br>I loved it. The show needed to introduce the 3 characters, and did it with brilliant timeline switching. I loved having a backstory to the stoic Yennefer, who Geralt was madly in love with in the game but she was a sarcastic edgelord who was powerful and wanted to help ciri for some reason. The show game me a backstory to her attitude and reason to want to save ciri. <br><br> I understand that lore channels know soooo much about the world that certain changes might be offensive and this is where I should have known George would have disliked it. But I really didn&#39;t think George would seriously hate it that much, and was hoping for videos expanding on the show and perhaps showing the differences from the books. Like he did with the changes in games.  But I guess thats wishful thinking now :(<br>PS I&#39;m sorry you didn&#39;t like it, but you shouldn&#39;t be sorry you didn&#39;t like it...
This show is a disgrace for the original work.<br>Feminist crap certainly is more important than the source material.<br><br>What bothers me most is that no one mentions the elephant in the room.<br><br>The show sucks, and any true fan knows it.<br>Many just can&#39;t bare to admit it.<br>Netflix Witcher is as woke as star wars, marvel and almost every single piece of entertainment.<br>Gotta obey the Reich
Still better then GOT season8 ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
As someone that has not read the books nor played the games I really enjoyed the show. Maybe i was blessed with a little ignorance on this one, because if I do read lore or play games for something like this first i do find myself not enjoying show if it does not stay True to a story i originally loved. Still I always find myself looking for reviews because I‚Äôm interested in other opinions on the matter. I do feel like there was not really a good and a bad because i saw enough shit from both sides, But i do completely see where you are coming from. Nonetheless i enjoyed this review and appreciatie your honesty. Don‚Äôt apologize for your opinion though. What i am going to apologize for is my english in some. I‚Äôm a dutch guy and my autocorrect van be pretty annoying hahah. Have a Nice day all!
I see the series more as an interpretation of the witcher books. They adapted some stuff from the books and made their own storyline out of it.<br>Personally i think some stuff like brokylon was really done bad but than i liked the yennefer backstory episode. <br>First impression after watching the show the first time i would call as &quot;mixed&quot;
In my personal opinion, i love this show, and will have a good future. Just like the books or the games, is marvelous and fantastic. And i&#39;m happy that one of my favorite uiniverses, is adapted finally with such good quality.
My only experience with The Witcher are the games which I have played, let&#39;s just say quite a few times and my opinion about the show is that it&#39;s ok, but not more or less. For me it is either a 5 or a 6 out of 10. I think first of all that while this isn&#39;t the most accurate version on Geralt I think it was pretty good and I think Henry did a great job, I honestly really didn&#39;t like it&#39;s non linear storytelling and while I was able to keep up with the events I still think that it&#39;s waaaayyy too all over the place. <br><br>Apart from Jasker/Dandelion I think Geralt&#39;s relationships with other characters where a bit weird and off. I didn&#39;t like how they depicted most character&#39;s like Yennefer, Triss, Fringilla, Foltest and the kingdom of Nilfgaard.<br><br>I will stop here with a last small problem I had which I felt weird with the final scene where Ciri and Geralt hug in a really emotional moment which I kind of get but it felt off since they never really interacted with eachother. There are certainly some good things in this show and I can easily why someone would like it but for me it is adequate.
As LOTR fan, sometimes you have to accept a different medium ,requires diffrent methods. I kinda, look at the movies and books, as similar but separate versions. ( otherwise I would  go insane üòâ)<br>I think , (with the Series) ,that they really got the world feel right, even if some of the details ,had me going WTF!<br>Cavill did an amazing job, capturing Geralt, plus our famous Bard&#39;s scenes are hilarious . The actresses ,deserve kudos as well.
I am having a problem with the 3 different time lines its trowing me of xD i am ath the last episode hopefully that&#39;s maks some things claer i would rather have 1 time line. I think its a bad thing wen i as the viewer needs to research whats actually going on and when i mean is that i realized in ep7 that somting from ep4or5   happend already in somwane elses time line and i noticed that some things where not right wath made me think of more timelines(what made the internet approve my thought later) i think they could have shown the viewers more when such things happen allow me to give a simple explanation : when the switcht to ciri =year 120 or something then they swith tho gerald=124 then you immediately now ow this is a couple of years before or after now you just need to find that out yourself thats my ownly problem but tho be claer i like it 7/10would want tho se more
All the changes of the story are really unnecessary, and are in fact making it worse. They aren&#39;t subtle either. It is actually shocking, that they pretend to care. If the show writer thinks that she can make a better story, why not make her own. I thought the Polish TV adaptation was bad, this is actually worse. They only had more resources. The show isn&#39;t bad in it&#39;s own right, it just isn&#39;t what it pretends it is. All the stories are butchered in the name of... what exactly?!<br><br><br>Hereby I declare Lauren Hissrich the real Butcher of Blaviken.
Less a review and more a I hate it because they changed it from the books kind of video. But i do agree with the Brokolin bit.
Good review. I read the last wish already 2008 and played the first game shortly after and I was hooked. The Witcher saga and all the lore that surround it is important if you want to have a deeper understanding of the world. Because its complex and well thought out. Yes it is changes and I also find it hard to accept but I see some potential in the Netflix series and you can clearly see that first season is more of a teaser and set up for the coming seasons. So I wish and hope that next season will prove it.
Awesome show
Thank the gods! I‚Äôve been feeling so alone in not really liking the show
I thought they did ok. The biggest win for the show so far is that Cavill nailed his role. Also, Yen grew on me. But the writing overall left much to be desired. For example: While is enjoyed Geralt and Yen&#39;s first meeting, everything about their dynamic felt rushed afterwards. The show should&#39;ve dedicated at least one full episode to fully flesh out their dynamic, which in turn would&#39;ve made their fight at the top of the mountain more emotional and authentic. Also, the writers did little to make me care about Ciri and her journey. She should&#39;ve been fleshed out more. Also, what I found distracting was the random insertion of black people in scenes to appear woke/inclusive. I guess they were afraid of the twitter mob coming after them for not including enough black people. A lot of these characters simply felt out of place given the geographical location of this fantasy land and the source material. While I got over the Yen casting pretty quickly, and I&#39;ll even get over Triss eventually, Fringilla is another story. That was simply a bad casting choice, one done for the sake of diversity.
Re Star Wars: No matter what the remake says, Han Solo shot first...
I personally am indifferent about the show, there are some things I really like about it and alot that I really hate. The first big problem is Yennefer. I have no problem with the actress portraying her, while she doesn‚Äôt look exactly like the Yennefer we would expect, I think the actress is good enough where this is forgivable. My problem lies with Yennefer‚Äôs story and character arc. While the show is called ‚ÄúThe Witcher‚Äù I feel like it should be called ‚ÄúThe Sorceress‚Äù because it seems that Yennefer is given more screen time than Geralt and Cirilla combined. I don‚Äôt know if this was an attempt by the writers to show more backstories and lore than are shown in the books and video games, or if it was simply a change made by the writers to make the show more of their own work. This brings me to my next point, which is that it seems like so much shit was changed just for the sake of change. My main concern is the obvious intentional change of the physical appearance of characters. The first of which is just randomly black characters. While in our current world it is normal to see the level of integration apparent in the show, it however makes zero sense for the world of the Witcher. They lack the technology for the ease and abundance of emigration in the show. For example, it is never mentioned or even addressed why Calanthe‚Äôs guard is black, they just shrug it off like its normal. I would be okay with this if it was simply explained how a black man found his way to personally guard one of the most important people in the northern kingdoms. It just seems like that would be and interesting story. Instead they pretend like his family must‚Äôve always been from Cintra despite him looking nothing like them. The second example is of the black elf with Ciri. If you‚Äôre going to make a fictional race, it is important for that race to have similar physical characteristics (plural), not just one (pointy ears). This in my opinion is the most obvious intentional change especially due to the poor acting skills of the person who plays him, clearing showing that they only casted him because he was black. The third and final example is Triss Merigold. I personally, having only played the games, an a fan of triss, so maybe I have a bias in this regard, but he is my opinion none the less. Given what we know about sorceresses, their attractiveness seems relevant. As shown even in the show, while different, sorceresses use magic to enhance their appearance, so it makes zero sense that Triss in the show is ugly. On top of this, I don‚Äôt even think the actress is inherently ugly, I think the make up team made her ugly. If they were going to change Triss‚Äôs complexion so drastically, then why didn‚Äôt they just change her entire appearance like Fringilla. It just looks wrong to paint freckles on someone with that dark of skin tone. My last complaint and most important of the show is the elimination of moral ambiguity. This is also a criticism on society as a whole due to this being such a common occurrence nowadays. The first example of this is in the first episode with the change in Blaviken. The reason I feel they changed this was so that viewers wouldn‚Äôt get a bad first impression of Geralt, due to most people‚Äôs tendency to commit black and white fallacies. Assuming that Geralt is all bad because he killed some villagers for the common good, instead they change it to him killing only the bad people out of self defense because that‚Äôs easier for most people to comprehend. The second occurrence is with King Foltest. Having only played the games, the only experience I have of Foltest is from the beginning of the second Witcher. However, to me, this experience was very impactful as from this, he is one of my favorite characters. In both the show and the games, Foltest is an asshole, but the difference is the kind of asshole. In the games Foltest is still strong and intelligent while being an arrogant prick. In the show, he is an incompetent fat sloth because if someone is an asshole, most people would be confused if they weren‚Äôt entirely bad. However the significance of this is that it makes no sense given Foltest‚Äôs backstory. How could a fat incompetent sloth be the hero of brenna, the iron fist that held the northern realms together against the mighty Nilfgaardian Empire. This brings me to my last example, the Empire of Nilfgaard. The show has atrociously transformed Nilfgaard into some brainless evil Empire, again due to the simplicity of the antagonist being evil. In my opinion the worst part about this is that it is simply boring. It is much more interesting to have morally complex character. This worries me about the show, because it was the same rabbit hole GoT fell into making characters like Stannis and Jamie evil when the entire essence of their characters was morally grey.
First, don&#39;t apologize for your opinion. It&#39;s valid. I personally have issues with this video because your opinion boils down to &quot;they changed things.&quot; Of course they changed things, it&#39;s an adaptation. And I think they had to. A good number of the stories are short stories with as you mention, main characters only making brief appearances later on. I personally think if they didn&#39;t give Yennifer more of a backstory, when she was featured more prominently in the story, we wouldn&#39;t care because we don&#39;t know who she is.
I agree with you but you should&#39;ve called out that American assistant director who probably made those changes. I dot understand Americans, always changing things to suit their way, it&#39;s disrespectful to the culture of the book and Poland. She made so many changes and deliberately made yennefer so prominent than she should be and it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s woke culture rather than exploring Geralt and ciri relationship more. I gave it a 8.5 /10 but after a expert like ur self highlighting this I give it a 7.5 or 7, and reason is if I had as much knowledge about witch as you I would be so angry I would probably hate it so I can understand your disappointment in the show.
The show is based  on the books, not 100% books
You ARE nitpicking. Your &quot;you may feel like&quot; bullshit at the beginning earned an instant down. Saying &quot;I can nitpick MORE&quot; is not an argument against you nitpicking. You literally use them expanding upon offhand comments in the books as a criticism. I&#39;ve read the books, played the games, and am invested in the world and your opinion is bullshit. It is an adaptation. Learn what that is.<br><br>Your criticism comes off as why whiny and petulant. Your continual usage of &quot;that just isn&#39;t the witcher&quot; and &quot;as someone invested in this world who has read the books&quot; comes off as you speaking down to other who have done just that and can still enjoy the show for what it is. I came here hoping to see someone who claims to be knowledgeable about the books explain the differences and the positives and negatives of those changes. Instead I got a whiny, nitpicky, self-immolating garbage where you spend more of the video apologizing for your &quot;educated&quot; opinion than backing your own criticisms with anything substantial.
This is a Netflix show that we made tocbe its ‚Äúown‚Äù! They never once said they were going to make this show 100% accurate with the books and games ? So your criticism is just fanboy hate lol great video and love your other videos but this is a show on its own grounds and isn‚Äôt meant to be accurate.... why can‚Äôt people understand that
I just want to say that im one who read the books and played the games and i was still able to enjoy the show. For me i was able to have that disconnect as it is an interpretation like based on type thing, however that being said i watched your vid and i completely agree with you as well haha. Anyways keep it up with the awesome content!
I play video games and read books, but I‚Äôve never played or read any of the Witcher stuff.  I do enjoy SF and fantasy tho.  When I first saw the trailer for the show I kinda thought ‚Äúmeh‚Äù.  Then I binge watched the season over a couple days and actually enjoyed the series.  Some of the plot was a bit hard at points to follow, but I liked it.  I didn‚Äôt know people are comparing it GoT which seems silly.  Watch what you like I say.
I feel this way about other shows and movies. But I enjoyed the show
I like the show. Hated the over the top religious fanaticism for Nilfgaard, seemed incredibly idiotic. Hated the Nilfgaardian armor. Thought Yennefer should be older, Ciri younger and missed the Triss from the games. Wished it was a longer season so they could‚Äôve expanded and explored the story more. But still liked the show.<br><br>And yeah...never read the books.
But Netflix know most people didint play games or read the books thats a point why they changed story and that with scene Visenna and young Geralt was needed for most people if it was like you said would be boring. Think a little bit mate
This is the first fictional tv series I have watched since 2007 (mainly stick to documentaries and comedies)...and I regret it, as a massive witcher 3 fan.  The series mainly suffered from b-rate acting and even worse dialog.  The verbal interchanges between characters so frequently comes across as pretentious and forced.  It completely ruined any desire I had to immerse myself in the viewing experience.<br><br><br>Oh and, as others have addressed, the pacing (flash-forwards and flashbacks) issues were not always immediately apparent and led to confusion.<br><br><br>OH AND THE GRATUITOUS NUDITY!  Like it didn&#39;t even deign to be classy...I feel like either the screenwriter/director is basically a sexually-repressed perv.  The nudity was so soooooooo gratuitous.  I quit the show after ep. 5.<br><br><br>Also, the socio-literary themes and concepts seemed out of time/place but I could be an idiot since I never read the books just played Witcher 3 and lotsa wikia pages.
That nilfgard wasn&#39;t backwater in a world perspective is right but I think it&#39;s totally fine to say so from a northern kingdom perspective as it didn&#39;t play much of a role in there struggle with each other.<br>Also this ain&#39;t a 1:1 copy of bthe books so, rather say it&#39;s different not wrong as they tell their own story in the series.<br>I see your points and would have liked it too with them sticking a bit closer to the books, though I think your wording make it look more negative than it is and you maybe even mean it. :) Liked the review overall though :)
This comment is being written after only watching the video up to 13mins:<br><br>You mentioned that thoss unfimilar with the witcher may enjoy it based on it being a new fantasy show with a high budget and I have to disagree. As someone who played ALLOT of witcher 3 I enjoyed the show solely because of it being new stories that filled gaps in my understanding of characters and events but if I&#39;m being honest I dont think the show holds up on it&#39;s own merits without prior experience with the series. The witcher mutations are never properly explained, witcher potions arnt explained, kingdom layouts arnt explained and political motivations are shallow. All those things together make the story difficult to follow without already knowing certain things (geralt can heal faster through the use of witcher potions but cant heal others with them because they require mutations, geralts eyes are black sometimes due to the toxic nature of potions that enhance his abilities, skellige can only send ships to contra as opposed to marching because they&#39;re an island nation ect) That&#39;s just what&#39;s missing in terms of world building, add in some hit or miss dialogue, cringy camera work, poor depictions of large battles and flawed logic (in particular the magic) and on it&#39;s own it probably feels like a high budget show with cw level writing. With the knowledge I have from the games I&#39;d give the season as a whole a 7.5/10 with there being near perfect episodes but its hit or miss.
I respect everyone‚Äôs opinion but this is my favourite show ever released topping the punisher and game of thrones.  I thought it was incredible! I‚Äôm a huge fan of the games and want to read the books I absolutely loved it especially Cavills performance
NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF ASKING WHERE IS THE FUCKING SILVER SWORD. He is killing striga with normal sword lol.
It felt like cheap fantasy series with poor graphics. Also i rly hate those Yen and Tris casting, horrible. Im not even talking about black elf and other black actors in the show. Rly horrible. I dont know. ..
Its pretty meh. If I won&#39;t  a witcher fan I dont think I&#39;d like it at all. Henry is awesome and all but I still can&#39;t get over how buff he is, so my immersion is a bit killed when hes on screen but its alright because he does play him well. Tress casting is terrible,  looks nothing like tress. Yen is a pretty bad cast as well although I dont mind her acting. Really dont like how the story flows with it going back and forth in time every 2 seconds.  It feels as if the charcters fall in love way to quickly. They go from not liking each other to being long time friends ( imagine it has somthing to do with time skips ) dont really feel the chemistry. Although the end gave me chills.
I respect your opinion!  I‚Äôm new to The Witcher so it‚Äôs nice to learn about the differences between the the books, games and tv series.  Thank you for sharing.
I&#39;ve read the book series twice, and I still enjoyed the show for the most part. I went in with low expectations, and didn&#39;t expect the show to be a carbon copy with all of the lore from a massive universe. I agree with most of your major negatives about the show, but I think nitpicking an adaptation of something only leads to further disappointment.<br><br>The changes to the Brokilon plot pissed me off, and the portrayal of Nilfgaard/Cahir/Fringilla was horrendous.
Bruh this man fucking babbled for way too long about being sorry. Like fuckin talk bruh
Unfortunatelly I agree with your review. I like the show, mostly because of the effort they put in creating it. But the changes in the plot seems to be unnecessary and flattened story a lot. Political and social commentaries are almost non-existent and it was really important in books. There is no dark humor at all and I really do not like some visual decisions. In general the show is rather averege and for now it is not even close to GoT...
Ahem. <br><b>ballsack armor</b><br>That is all.
I like their first meeting in the show.<br><br>However, that the show kinda rushed it. If they did it in S2 and built Geralts &quot;need&quot; for her, then it would have moved me to tears.
I personally liked the show a lot, but have not read all of the books. I will say that there were a lot of problems that held the show back from being better than it was.<br><br>The two timelines were exceptionally confusing and it&#39;s got a lot to do with editing, an unnecessary focus on Ciri&#39;s story, and in turn the script.<br><br>Editing: showing these scenes side by side gives the impression that it&#39;s happening concurrently. There&#39;s no indication that these are years apart. I&#39;ve read articles where they&#39;ve wanted to have it be a reveal, but there really isn&#39;t a need for one. Like why? It does nothing for the story other than delay a fact which should&#39;ve been known immediately. <br><br>Focus on Ciri: as states in the video, she escapes Cintra, then finds Geralt. Those are the only important things Ciri does so why do we see her entering Brokilon Forest, meeting an inconsequential elf boy, fighting a doppler, and meeting a family...twice? They don&#39;t matter. It was just padding. <br><br>The script: here&#39;s what I feel like should have happened, so it&#39;s not really a problem with the show, just an alternative suggestion. <br><br>Show starts out with Ciri&#39;s escape from Cintra, with little no context as to who she is or why we&#39;re even watching this scene. We don&#39;t need to see her family dynamic etc, etc. Title screen. Cut to a candlelit temple, unconscious Geralt being wiped clean of the blood, from a recent battle. We see his many scars (this is an important feature later), the most fresh scar being the one on his neck. The next morning Geralt wakes up and hears priestesses are discussing the fall of Cintra. <br><br>This puts Geralt in the same timeline as Ciri. We could also bring in a character from the short stories that Geralt interacts with while he heals from his most recent wound.<br><br>Here&#39;s where the point of showing his scars comes in narratively. Geralt in the show already states that everyone asks about his scars. The meat of his portions are showing how he got them. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s talking to that character from the book about the one on his forehead. Flashback to meeting Jaskier and his encounter with the elves. Or one on his arm. Flashback to the Renfri. The final one, as you might have guessed, is how he got the scar on his neck and how he came to the temple after being almost fatally wounded by the striga. <br><br>It provides a nice narrative frame to differentiate between then and now. And if we want to be updated on Ciri, anytime we cut to her, it&#39;s from a scene of Geralt in the present day. Also, these scenes don&#39;t need to be long. Maybe a stinger at the end of each episode until the final episode when everyone is in the present day and actively doing something, and all their storylines are finally converging.<br><br>Yennefer: I personally really like Yennefer&#39;s character and I think her actress is astounding. But...her origin story did not need to be told over the course of multiple episodes. In one episode, first establish Yennefer in the present, then have the majority of the episode feature her cruel past, and ascendance into who she is now. After that, keep her present day. There&#39;s a lot going on that needs more attention than, &quot;Yennefer was ugly and treated badly, now she&#39;s hot and power hungry.&quot;<br><br>Or if they want to do multiple episodes, frame it the way Geralt is framed. Her origin comes up when it&#39;s relevant. Write and edit it so we remember with her. <br><br>These characters should be veterans when we meet them because their whole existence more or less centers around Ciri. We can&#39;t feel like they&#39;re just as fresh to this world as Ciri, which is what would definitely happen if we follow them start to finish.
Your argument about the lack of back story with the dragon and then complain about developing a back story for yen and ciri. Imagine if you weren&#39;t a huge Witcher fan, you need to establish these characters
I watched a minute and a half of this before I thought there was no point listening to him tell me how bad he thinks the show is for 20 minutes. Whole minute at the beginning really make me not care
Geez take it for what it is. You sound pompous by continually saying &quot;in the books&quot;.
To me the yennifer and ciri storyline was really boring... iv only played the games, so idk maybe I was expecting the show to be more about geralt and the witchering trade... I wanted to see him brew potions go on hunts interact more with the world and it seemed like they wanted to focus more on yen and ciri. HOnestly the first season shouldn&#39;t be called the witcher but more like yennifer.
I don‚Äôt know man after watching the first four episodes I dug out my Xbox 360 to play assassin of kings while wild hunt downloads straight had the game but never got to it but the show has really got me into the rest of the Witcher story. <br><br>Might just be a dirty casual tho.......
The problem with this video is that it‚Äôs skewed.  It‚Äôs fine to have an opinion, but you are so overly invested in having a 1:1 adaptation that it‚Äôs a big turn off.  Try talking about at least a few if the many great things instead of micro-focusing on adaptational differences and painted them as negative
This is best fantasy show of the year
As long as the criticism is fair, I have no problem with it.  Usually, I think criticism is fair if it is objective.  It is when you add emotion to criticism that it gets skewed
@witcherGeorge I understand where you&#39;re coming from, especially since they changed so much from the books which doesn&#39;t make much sense since it&#39;s their main source material. Anyway, I&#39;ve played the games A LOT and just started reading the books, so my opinion on the NETFLIX series is not to expect too much, since the Witcher 3 was a masterpiece and the books are (I&#39;ve heard) exceptional, there&#39;s literally no way the TV adaption could live up to them. I enjoyed it for the exact reasons you mention, it tells stories of the world and lore that I love, that&#39;s it. It ain&#39;t going to win any oscar&#39;s but as a Witcher fan I support the show 100%
Just reading the descriptions of the episodes caused me not to watch the series. I read the French translations of the books years ago and don&#39;t see myself enjoying a rendition of the prose so far off the reservation.
I only played Witcher 2 and Witcher 3, I was really hyped, and loved the show for what it is. (Obviously I am no Witcher expert), but in my experience with the show, it made me stop checking my phone, and got me paying a lot of attention. <br><br><br>Best part I&#39;d say, for me would be Geralt and Dandelion, the score throughout the show is on point, I am just happy that this show immersed me, just like the games did.<br><br><br>I feel bad for you that you couldn&#39;t enjoy it as much as I did man, but it&#39;s okay that&#39;s life, we see things different.<br><br><br>Thanks for your review :)
So, about the Witcher of thrones‚Ä¶ I think the author said it best, first when quoting Kipling, ‚ÄúThis is the East and West is West, and the two will never meet‚Äù He continued, &quot;The adaptation will never be be found in the Original. Adapters must be fitted.&quot; Netflix didn‚Äôt want his opinion, &quot;they paid him some money to keep his mouth shut‚Äù as he said. &quot;When you write, you have to know how to start and end it.&quot; <br><br><br>I had such an aww moment in both your reviews thus far. Both times because you have gone to great lengths, to measure carefully your thoughts, and are genuinely attempting to allay fears, and recognize individual thought for those who may feel provoked. I will stand arms wide, against the rabble, here and now. There are two takes on this ‚Äúshow‚Äù. One is the show versus the game, the other is the show versus the books.<br><br><br>In either case I have not heard opinion as much as I have observed you recounting the differences actually, which is after all, what you have been doing all along. Since this is your sandbox, and you put in the time to make it,  you should at the very least be allowed to say what you think while your are in it.           At the very height of the social season, when many of us barely have time for ourselves, you are ever diligent to maintain the quality information you have always provided for our knowledge and entertainment. Those who seek out others with dissenting opinions, have been both confused and wrong. They have an under developed sense of purpose and more than a modicum of free time. It is not rational to become emotional distressed over a program another person doesn&#39;t care for.  If you have done anything for them, in my Opinion, which I have a high regard obviously, you gave them a merry holiday by recognizing them. <br><br><br>I Enjoy the game, watching others I mean. I Enjoy watching your channel and learning of things I didn‚Äôt know. I have decided to view the ‚Äúshow‚Äù for time, as another entity, and attempt to enjoy it, IF the writers can manage to put some Substance in, and allow the actors to Act and take up less screen time with dismemberment, flashbacks and the soft core porn. This is something everyone could have been watching anytime they wanted, providing they didn‚Äôt mind being seen in ‚Äúthose stores‚Äù  and hidden.  But this  is now fashionable, it is now an officially sanctioned entertainment genre, so it‚Äôs okay. Guess what,  It was always okay, even back  when I handed you your change for purchase.  I do wish the people with the money had more sense, and would not just Use the name of an Old show, book or game and not even attempt to follow it. The public will watch what it likes, so write your damn crap, name it whatever you want, and stop riding the coat tails of better artists. <br><br><br>I would like to see more of the differences you have seen, broken down by episode AND would like to know what did happen, in as much as you are aware. I would also like your thoughts. Thank you
I&#39;m okay with it being different. It&#39;s not the Witcher books, it&#39;s an adaptation and an interpretation. It doesn&#39;t need to be the books, since... well, we still have the books. Nothing is going to replace them as ultimate Witcher canon. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing where they go with this TV show, and as long it doesn&#39;t end up disappointing me as much as Game of Thrones did, I&#39;ll give it a fair shake.
The show is fucking awesome
Yeah, this show was my first real introduction into the witcher world. I&#39;m a lot more interested in reading the books now. I kind of like when shows are legitimate adaptations, simply because we get to see different types of stories that could come out of the world. I get that it&#39;s not the original story, but I like that I have both versions to enjoy.
I understand and can certainly agree with you. I&#39;ll preface with I have always been interested in the series, but never had the time to play the game. However, would this show be any good if it was a carbon copy of the books? Like most of your points are &quot;they arent in the books and made up&quot;, but personally I feel like they used Yen, Ciri, and Geralt to carry the story forward, and it was a choice, I enjoyed it, but I know that the crew knew the content, they know what they changed too. Idrk I am just pointing out that just cause the book did something differently doesnt mean its bad?
You&#39;re not actually reviewing NETFLIX The Witcher are you? Youre just comparing how accurate it is to the books or how it compares your subjective standard that nobody can have but you. do you realise the scope of this franchise? The books do not even cover the 200hr withcer3 game let alone the other 2. so how do you expect a business to cover over 500 hrs worth of content and make a profit without altering it a bit? not to mention it has to be casual friendly. im grateful this even exists and i am enjoying it very much.
This review could have been 1/2 as long without all the apologizing and justifying. Dude you have an opinion, if people don‚Äôt like it they are free to make their own vids. Cheers mate, good review.
Previous I looked into The Witcher law thought it was interesting but kinda forgot about it. Watched series &gt; bought all 3 games to play through at a leisurely pace. Goodtimes
Netflix Witcher in a nutshell:<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cULGfZkvSHg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cULGfZkvSHg</a>
Henry Cavil nailed it, every time he was on screen I was happy.
As a game fan and fan of the game&#39;s lore, and really enjoying the show and having a few criticisms but overall liking it ... going around to my favorite loretubers and watching them pick apart this show (rightfully) just hurts/sucks. Ah well ... thank you anyway
@WitcherGeorge what can the show do different in Season 2, to make it better?
Thank you for your review. It is interesting to hear a review from someone with a much deeper in-world-knowledge. I have played the witcher 3, a bit of witcher 1 and 2 and I am vaguely aware of the books- so I didn&#39;t go into the series with a lot of baggage or expectations. <br>Despite all of this I am quite disappointed by it nevertheless:<br>The acting was horrendous in many cases (except of Yennefer): Cavill acted as if he just came out of the Clint-Eastwoods-acting-by-keeping-the-teeth-closed-school. He managed to show some more emotional range by the end of the show, however by that point his character turned already uninteresting. I missed a lot of the Witcher&#39;s dark humor and Doug Cockle&#39;s varied speach pattern that was present in the games. <br>Ciri&#39;s actress was unconvincing and most other actors only emoted a single emotion (even if they had bigger roles in the story with a much bigger needed emotional range I.e. MyAnna Buring as Tissiana). <br>The casting choices were terrible: I had NO IDEA who should be who... not only because people were swapped (Triss Merigold) or left out completely, but in many cases they didn&#39;t have any familiar trait that I could recognize. Fringilla for example was the worst miscast- she was supposed to be so similar to Yennefer that the Witcher clearly was only interested in her because of it (here she not only has NO PHYSICAL similarity but her whole character is reduced to being devoted to the white flame).<br><br>Some of the set-and world-designs looked very cheap (Witcher&#39;s wig, the cliff when they lost the gold dragon, the Nilfgaard armor, some suits, the Wolf-amulet) and the special effects stood out (why did the dragons look so bad when they looked so good in GOT?). <br>In some cases they changed the very designs that were described in the books for no apparent reason (I.e. striga&#39;s red hair and breasts being the only human aspects being recognisable).<br><br>Furthermore, the music was very bad. Many musical cues were really off and there were out of place rock songs playing (in contrast to the fitting slavic inspired songs that played in the witcher 3 game).<br>I fully understand that there are people claiming that they are confused by the chosen storytelling method. I had no problem to follow the stories as I knew beforehand which episode unfolds in what timeframe, but it seems to be difficult to follow without prior knowledge as the episodes themselves do not give any clues.<br><br>I hope that they lose the color filters altogether. The first couple of episodes had no color left and when they did they&#39;re almost washed out. I understand that it should give us the feeling that the world is dark and dirty but it is not an interesting watch when all one can see is a palett going from white to black for 30 minutes.<br><br>Finally, some things were plain old nonsensical I.e. Nilfgaard sacrificed two witches only to shoot a firey ball from a trebuchet at a castle knowing full well that they have a barrier and it won&#39;t be effective. People gain and lose magical powers for no apparent reason. The witcher has not only been enhanced by mutagens but spent his whole life training to kill monsters yet people sometimes are able to overcome him in pure combat strength when the plot needs it. The &quot;treedrink&quot; could have been skipped as it had no apparent effect (they skipped on the dryads procreation aspect altogether).
I get your gripes especially the changes in Ciri&#39;s story which bothered me and how they hollywood Yennefer at the battle of Sodden, but I&#39;m trying my best to treat the netflix adaptation separate to the books so that I can enjoy both the books and netflix series individually but damn it&#39;s confusing alternating between the books and netflix series now!
I have read the books and I don&#39;t like the show too..
You nitpicked the show to death. RIP<br>Your opinion is like, not liking every book to tv show adaptation because they didnt remake the show exactly like the book. You shouldnt hold a TV Show to the standards of a book...<br>At the end of the day, you still have your book with the perfect story to you.<br>With that being said, my viewpoint is from someone who played the games and didnt read the books.<br>I liked the tv show, It was a 9/10 for me, as a fantasy story. The story excelled at there always being lesser of two evils, and gerald having to choose, it doesnt pander to SJW, which is a huge pro considering the SJW movement is loud.<br>My biggest gripe is the time jumping, and plot explaining, they did good, but they could of done more to leave clues.<br>My nitpicks are geralds hair does look ehhh, and how atfirst his armor is always so plastic looking, they need to better weather his armor, or show his armor getting fixed up and cleaned atleast once.
I really like the show.  Very much.  However, I am coming in clean, as I haven&#39;t read the books, and I haven&#39;t played the games, as fantasy/swordplay is not my thing in gaming.  I do love great single player titles, but I lean more toward Mass Effect/TLOU/God of War/Horizon Zero Dawn etc. etc. than a Witcher type of game.  <br><br><br>I know that not having any perspective on the books or the games means this is fresh to me, and if I had played the games or read the books certainly my opinion would be different, more critical I&#39;m sure.  But as someone who has no history with the franchise, I say I love what I&#39;m seeing.  I&#39;m six episodes in, two to go.  I&#39;ve got plenty of shows in my queue I&#39;m watching across platforms like Amazon Prime video, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu.  But right now, The Witcher has captured my attention more than even a show like The Expanse, which I was looking forward to it&#39;s return mightily, and even more so than The Mandalorian, which I think is also very good.  Of course, I can&#39;t binge the Mandalorian, so maybe it&#39;s not a fair comparison in that regard.  <br><br><br>For right now, The Witcher is the only show across the platforms where I watch an episode, then say immediately to myself that I have to watch the next one.
Yo man I respect what you&#39;re saying and sure makes sense. But I believe that shows should not follow books to the t because then it will just become repetitive and predictable.
DB2 did the same thing with Game of Thrones.  Calm down, yes, I‚Äôm comparing Witcher to GoT, get over it.  My point is that even die hard fans of the GRRM‚Äôs books liked the show.  They seemed to understand that expecting a page for page translation isn‚Äôt just IMPOSSIBLE, but simply a retarded, pimply faced asshole‚Äôs wet dream that just doesn‚Äôt work on screen.  Just because you can picture it, doesn‚Äôt mean it can capture the hearts of fans and casual viewers alike.  They had to simplify a lot of the story, and as much as I loathe neo-feminism they ultimately had to make Yennefer a stronger female character  with confidence to match Geralt in order to bring a balance that was sorely missing from the books.  Yes, I love the books, but for God‚Äôs sake I want more than one main character.  <br><br>In any regard, I love the books, and I love the show.  I don‚Äôt feel bad about your opinion, and I love the fact that your so passionate about it that you tried very hard to prepare everyone by prefacing with a warning.  Cheers.
I loved the 3rd game, never read the books. I found the show to be messy. The time jumps were jarring. Also, I didn&#39;t like any of the characters in the series while almost every character in witcher 3 was unique and interesting.
As someone who only played the Witcher 3 I totally agree with you. A lot of the scenes season one seemed unnecessary to me that are just there to building drama or tension that I feel unnatural. And portrait Nilfgard as evil guys are the most unnatural thing that turns a complicated political scenario in to a Gondor vs Mordor thing. Which is totally not the point we look for in the Witcher series. I mean I guess the show is ok, and it&#39;s cool Witcher is getting more awareness through this. but I think its just mediocre and overhyped. Also people have no background knowledge will find it impossible to understand so many times. <br>Damn I really should play the first two games and read all the books. Wish I have time for that.
I liked the show but I still don&#39;t know how I feel about the actors playing Yen and Jaskier. And Foltest? No comments.
The disjointed flashbacks and cuts to future events back to past events was very hard to follow sometimes.
Switch between storylines every 3 minutes. Makes me hate it
I have read the books and played all the games. I like the show but some things witch are not like the books are anoying, but in the most things it was pretty good. The monster were good made with CGI. Yennerfers past was also good, it was good shown. The battle of Sodden Hill was in my mind and also in the books better like in the show.<br>But as you said, it is pretty confusing in some points, but I think I am just not as familiar as you, I think in your position I would think like you.
Don&#39;t forget that the author of the books is a consultant for the show
Mad respect. You said what i was thinking!
Also what I just realised is that Mousesack and Triss‚Äô power sets should have been swapped.
please make a nitpicking video about the show. I don&#39;t quite like it, wanna know exactly where went wrong.
I‚Äôm the same way about movies based on comics but I understand that film makers make their content for the general public not the fans of the content.
Please do make a detailed video about book changes. Would be interesting to see!
I can safely assume that from the show&#39;s standpoint, they chose to either improvise or elaborate on the character&#39;s background like Yennefer, so we could sympathize with her, while in the books and games, she&#39;s usually just a mysterious force of nature. They tried to humanize her and tell the audience, &quot; hey this beautiful baddass chick, was an inept ugly duckling once. Look how far she came&quot;.
Finally I know there was people who thought this show was trash I&#39;m not insane after all.
You expressed the exact thoughts I had after watching the show. I could&#39;ve never expressed it so nicely and in details. As a book reader the Netflix Witcher felt hollow. It was a 6/10 for me. Just hope season 2 is done better.
Having only played the games my biggest issue was with the bad editing. Right off the bat there&#39;s a shallow creek that some how had a giant monster and Gefalt fighting under in one scene then standing knee deep in the same scene. He rides into town on roach, goes into a pub, comes out to a giant monster taking up all of his horse. Where was the monster riding? There are also wardrobe changes in a simple camera angle. Cloaks disappear instantly.
Actually I thought it sticked pretty well to the source material. Having watched Game of Thrones, even in season 1 of GoT they made a LOT more changes than the Witcher did.
because of that length pre-warning, im going to watch the show first, i hasnt read any of the books so i thinking i rather go in not knowing where they went wrong. WILL WATCH YOUR REVIEW AFTER THO... FOR KNOWLEDGE SAKE.
I like it with the exception of triss.She is Fugly
I did enjoy the Netflix show, I&#39;ve only played wild hunt so my knowledge is limited, and so exploring the world and lore further through an easy medium is definitely appreciated. However I completely understand why you may not like it and I can definitely see the points you give as reasonable and understandable. However one benefit you may not have thought of is I am now interested in reading the books, more than the games made me. So starting with the last wish in the new year. Have a great Christmas
ermergawwwwdd how can you say such blasphemy... jokes. I fully agree with everything said I have played the games and read the books, and I was able to compare them, and I saw lots of inaccuracies, but I have to say I really liked this show because we got a live-action witcher and all the filler of yen and some of the inaccuracies, but they were probably done for the viewers who know nothing of the world and so I like to think of it as inspiration from the books and not a complete replication.
I agree with your viewpoint. You are clearly a huge fan of the Witcher universe and your expectations for this show are at a certain level that is not being met. I wish they had adapted the show a bit better and fixed some of the casting choices. I was so excited for the show but after watching it I‚Äôve definitely started feeling saddened at what could have been. Perhaps the second season will be better.
I appreciate your opinion and I think some of your points are good. However, some of these points are really nit picky.
I played the game then read the first book and graphic novels and have nearly finished the show. I&#39;ve also enjoyed it. However, I&#39;ve taken it like I have taken the series preacher and the boys. I&#39;ve read all of those to death and love the comics but they changed things to make it more palatable for a wider audience and I enjoyed them for what they are. Just some fun and something to watch and enjoy in. Their own right. I even enjoyed the adaption of good omens. But, and this is a big but, I love the book American gods and much like your opinion here, it is very hard to watch something you adore and love and not have what&#39;s in your head on screen. It was confusing and mildly heart breaking. Enjoyable enough but not what you hoped. Thanks for your honest and passionate opinion. I am a fan of the witcher and did start with the second game but haven&#39;t finished it. Have the third. Am still reading the novels etc... And love your loree series.
Thank you @WitcherGeorge for articulating my exact thoughts about the show! I LOVED THE GAMES. AND EVEN MOREE I LOVED THE BOOKS! But And I agree with everything you pointed out. Was a huge let down for me!
t kinda felt like this show was made by disney. Sorry Disney would do the CGI better than this. Bro i know we are all humans and we are not racist but what is african elves or african magician it just dont fits. ƒ∞n every fairytail or book or fantasy elves are white, not normally white they are very white. We get you netflix we are all brothers sisters no matter the skin color but for godssake let the african brothers and sisters act in african fairytails.<br><br>ƒ∞f you didnt read the books or played the game you gonna feel lost in this series because its so bad written so complicated written i couldnt believe.<br><br>Now the good sides are of course the sword fights and henry did a great job. He fits perfectly to the witcher role.<br><br>I hope they will fix these things for the next season. But for now its not the same level as GOT.
at this point im waiting when somebody gonna make &quot;everything wrong with The Witcher Netflix&quot; so yeah do it, make a 1 hour long rant about how difirent this is from books, i myself watched it with my friend and he did read the books unlike me, and he was even more confused then i did
Maybe its just a parallel universe?
In Tv show, Nilfgard is mostly portrayed from the perspective of Northerners, thus it is bad. Nobody is going to depict their invader as &quot;not inherently bad&quot;.But I personally never got the feeling that show was trying to depict them as evil per se. Also, I personally never thought that Cahir was depicted as &quot;just evil&quot; in the show, but rather extremely driven.
I hope you&#39;re planning on reviewing each epiosde <b>thoroughly</b> and <b>unapologetic</b> - that&#39;s why I sub to you. For the facts and lore if the Witcher Universe.<br><br>If someone gets offended because they clicked on your video, its their own fault.
Shots  to all the star wars rant videos
I guess my biggest thing is I don‚Äôt understand why you are getting so upset with the added material in the show, but you are totally ok when they do it in the games? seems like a double standard to me
Having read the books, I can understand your opinion. Personally I loved it. The 2 things I didn‚Äôt like either were cahir and geralt not meeting in Brokilon
Do not know the books, do not know the game, but I watched it, my conclusion:<br><br><br>Take GoT (you know the sex and violence) and throw as much 1980s fantasy film cheese as you can at it, I could have sworn I saw Warwick Davis in the background...<br><br><br>Ergo - I liked it!
I agree I hated everything they did with yennefer.  I dont think the actress even looks like yennefer.   Ciri too old .  merrygold doesnt look like merrigold in the books either.   they just did everything different from books and video game.
I liked the show and I&#39;m most of the way through the books. And played the games. I think ciri&#39;s geralt&#39;s, and yen&#39;s story&#39;s which are based over days, years, and decades respectively show their choices and how destiny pushes them together. So I think yen&#39;s backstory was key to that. Otherwise, the changes to magic, cahir and ciri&#39;s brokilon story are just wrong and don&#39;t make sense as you said. Like if magic is give and take, how do magic users make portals and such? Like yen in that chase sense?
The only reason this show is getting perfect audience score is that awhile back a group of fanboys gathered together from Reddit and Discord and planned to bomb IMDB and RT and every other platform with perfect scores from different accounts. Look at the reviews and almost all of them were recently created just to review this show.<br>Yennefer was a terrible miscast and belongs to a teen show. She had no chemistry with Geralt.  <br>The script looks like it was written for a teenage drama.
I got to say I really hate this kind of review. Basically, you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t like the tv-series because it isn&#39;t a word for word exact retelling of the books. I think you have to realize that tv and books aren&#39;t the same things, they are two different mediums. For you specifically, it would probably be better to compare the tv-show as something separate from the games and the books. This review is just a list of how the tv-series differs from what you expect it to be, rather than just judging tv-series.<br><br>Btw. has any book reader of a successful movie/tv series ever said the movie/tv-series was better? Does that even exist?
i really dont mind your opinion. and agree in quite some ways. But do you need to whinge while saying it? had to quit the video halfway cus the whingey tone just got to me. I dont mean to attack you on it, just some feedback
When the Brokilon storyline got completely  changed for no reason I wanted to throw the TV out of the window... the ending doesn&#39;t make sense. The constant underlying book theme of humanity vs nature is not shown at all. Just sad...
Your intro<br>When someone says it&#39;s not personal, just know its personal
I really don&#39;t get witcher fans saying &#39;I couldn&#39;t watch it&#39; as if they got cold sweats. Chill, it&#39;s a TV show. Sure, they ruined the adaptation part, but it&#39;s still more than watchable.
Literally not a single person is Slavic. But atleast we got black elves, right? <br>I&#39;m so fucking done, it&#39;s alright to erase Slavic people but there can&#39;t be missing black and anglosaxon people.
Hello George, out of so many witcher netflix review video, i think this is the best i have watch. I would love you to make another video to tell us all the details that the series deviated from the book.<br><br><br>Like most of witcher fans, I first like the lore from witcher games. Then I started to read the book to know more about the lore. Unfortunately, as reading is not my favourite past time, i stop reading when ciri is being caught in korath dessert (book 4 maybe?) <br><br><br>Anyway, I like this series a lot and I can&#39;t wait season 2. I like the Yennefer back story. But just like you I found some changes that the series made are unnecessary and annoyed as it is different from the book. Casting wise, i think jeskier &amp; geralt character are perfect, but I would always imagine that the sorceress are like victoria secrets angels as they were all describes as beautiful, flawless human being in the books, so thats a huge disappointment there. <br><br><br>Then the plot in the series is kinda confusing with the time jump. Even with some knowledge on the books, i still find it difficult to know which story or scene happen first. I could imagine the non-fans audience will be very much confuse. I would love you to do a timeline video of the series if you could. <br><br><br>Yes, the doppler plot is unnecessary as well and they f*cking killed Ermion!!! OMG moment. Sad that they killed Sir Eck early before the duel.  I played the thronebreaker games as well, Sir Eck is the exemplary knight. Disappointed that the way the show portrayed him. Also I was waiting for the scene where Yennefer enjoying the view when she &amp; geralt was hanging on the clift, but that did not happen. <br><br><br>I could not agree with you more  in the portray of nilfgard in the series. I think the books and games usually dont take sides, good or bad, evil or lesser evil.  IMO, all kings and politician has their own agenda, killings and war can be both noble and cruel cause depends on perspective. That being said this series potray Fringila as sort of the main antagonist of 1st season which I cannot understand especially playing the games. <br><br><br>About Cahir VS vilgefortz, I believe it could be just a show to con Yennefer? We all know Vilgefortz is a spy. <br><br><br>P/S: sorry for the long comments and the misspelled of the names. Hope you read this and makes more video on this series. Thank you
jesus stop going on about much of a lore expert you are...so is everyone else who has read these books. You come across as more of a game fan to me.
let me preface this by saying i am not attacking u or ur opinions. ur allowed urs as i am allowed mine. these are just my thoughts after watching ur vid.<br><br>it feels like ur letting the books get in the way of ur enjoyment of the show. and by that i mean ur not judging this show as a different form of media but rather as something that should have directly adapted the books, which almost never happens. in the video itself u say how the games are a separate continuity from the books, why not see this show in the same light? we know that it isnt the same witcher stories as in the books. i would be very interested to hear ur thoughts on this show based on the merits of its own storytelling.<br><br>now let me say this isnt me trying to defend the show, but rather me getting ppl to look at this show as a different form of media compared to the books. i personally have issue w the technical and narrative aspects of the show, but enjoyed it nonetheless bc of the strength of the idea behind the world and characters. personally wish they fixed up their pacing and storytelling however.
yea dude, maybe you could avoid complaining by making a comparison video instead of a review
I liked it, waiting for season 2... some things are not like expected...Some things should have been more like in the books... but you just can¬¥t put a book into a movie/series, that would just be too long.. (which would be great xD)
I thought the show was pretty clear in that the White Flame - aka Emhyr Var Emries was the reason the Empire had become such a force - it had nothing to do with Fringilla. And this is mostly accurate to the books. Emries is literally the reason the empire became so powerful and embarked on such a period of expansion in the north. It actually was a backwater at one point, a small collection of cities that first was a small kingdom then named itself a republic, then finally an empire (an obvious reference to Rome). Emries though was the one who made Nilfgaard the force it is, though the usurper who preceded himw as the one who took Nazair. <br><br><br>I also find it baffling that you have a problem with the fact they opted to show us Yen&#39;s backstory after it was heavily implied in the books and just not shown. Keeping her mysterious does NOTHING for her character. Just being mysterious for the sake of being mysterious is not how to write a good character - especially not one as central as her - where you get this ridiculous notion she was not an important character in the books and was just a side character is anyone&#39;s guess. She is very important and is the mother figure to Ciri much as Geralt is the father figure. This is Ciri&#39;s story first and foremost. And Yennefer was just as important to her as Geralt was. A huge amount of a time of contempt is devoted to Yennefer&#39;s journey with Ciri and their interactions, her trying to raise her and teacher her<br><br><br>And again, why bitch about the fact they opted to show Sodden? So just because the book doesn&#39;t go into detail about it you&#39;re complaining the show  decides to try and show us it? I commend them for it, and all in all it was okay. I personally would have just had the mages on a hill firing hell down on the nilfgaardians with magic rather than having the rather cheesy indivdual moments for each mage (the Vilgefortz one was total bullshit) but I commend their efforts.<br><br><br>I just think youre being way too much of a book purist. Im a huge fan of the books but overall i loved this show despite the changes it went for. Theres entire short stories it didnt adapt but mostly I get the decisions that were made to try and get a coherent season long narrative out of what was mostly standalone short stories that barely tied in to eachother . There were always going to be deviations and new written scenes to tie it all together
Dang I liked the show but I get you man
Worst show ever, just aweful.
He sounds like the guy that hates GoT because they didn&#39;t follow the plot in the books. These opinions are BORING. For example, he has zero opinions on the more controversial aspect of the shows like the miscasting of Triss. This video is a cop-out.
I think you went super super soft. Like, not even considering the lore flops: it was a bad audiovisual piece. Shots were floppy, dialogs were bbbbbad the postproduction was so cheaaap
Netflix Witcher was such a disappointment. Other shows like the Handmaid&#39;s Tale also made major changes from the book and yet the Handmaid&#39;s Tale show was still amazing. People can enjoy changes from the books if it benefits the end result and keeps in the same spirit as the books. The only people that are going to come after you for having an opinion that the Witcher wasn&#39;t great are employees of the the Witcher filming and production crew who are flooding social media with fake praise to get more seasons in.
I think the relationship of geralt and dandelion was the second worst thing after the silvan in episode 2 actually. And his singing ugh
I read the books and to be honest, they are not that good. They are middle of the road at best and one could argue the short stories are far better than the rest of the saga. I really think if they&#39;d stick too closely to books the show would fail hard. Sure the show isn&#39;t perfect and a lot of moments are just dull and uninteresting but i think they did an ok job setting up the larger story. Just imagine first season being just the last wish. People would be confused as fuck. I played all the games just once. I read all the books just once. I completely understand that people who made witcher part of they&#39;r identity and know every nook and cranny are upset. The show could never be what they envisioned and i think that is for the best. That being sad the show is not perfect ,strong 7/10. ( sorry for poor english )
I agree about everything,still gonna watch and enjoy it as much as I can.Great review.
As a fan of the books, the game, AND the TV show, I think you provided a wonderful and fair critique of the show.  It was helpful to put the comparisons in perspective since it&#39;s hard to remember all the details from the books, and you have been more than fair and as congenial as possible given your opinion.  How I personally get past it is much like how there are a plethora of different choices and outcomes in the game (currently almost finished with my 3rd playthrough).  I can suspend and/or alter judgment based on the MANY WORLDS HYPOTHESIS, or alternate realities.  I know that might remain difficult for some invested viewers, but it&#39;s how I&#39;m able to enjoy all 3.  Getting ready to listen to the books again while I drive my route and will probably watch the show again after that.  Happy Holidays!
I&#39;m enjoying the show thus far (I&#39;m on episode six as of right now,) but agree with your assessment. Having read the short stories featured in the show every change is glaringly obvious. Some I understand. For example, as much as I&#39;m disappointed in the episode with Borch (the devil in the fields as well, even more egregiously!) I understand why his role was so limited and understated: animating a dragon dueling knights in a field would have singlehandedly annihilated the budget, and so he kind of just stands there in underwhelming fashion. As a result one doesn&#39;t get as much feel for the character OR his plight, as in the show Saskia is still just...an egg that the audience is gonna give 0 shits about. <br><br><br>Budget limitations aside, many of the short stories don&#39;t get the time and development that they deserve because half of each episode is still dedicated to Ciri wandering Brokilon or Yennefer&#39;s, eh, origins (my opinion on her handling is another story). It&#39;s a shame because the short stories are so good and hilarious to boot, yet most of the source humour and development (the devil in the fields, again,) has been removed for time that in my opinion wasn&#39;t used wisely. Yennefer and Ciri are obviously important, but they&#39;re giving way too much too soon where a new audience now knows more about them and their motivations than they do Geralt&#39;s. As someone familiar I&#39;m able to enjoy it in the sense that I can fill in the blanks, but I have no idea how those who aren&#39;t are taking it. I&#39;m watching it with my family who know next to nothing and I had to explain the jumps in time. Trying to ensure that they understand what they&#39;re seeing without spoiling things later is the show writers job, not mine. I have no idea how anyone can get much out of it without prior knowledge as so much, sooooo much, has been left out.<br><br><br>Still bitter that the bathtub scene with Borch didn&#39;t happen. Still enjoying it.
I really wished Mads Mikkelsen was cast as Geralt. It feels like his likeness and demeanor would have fit the character a little better. I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ll still check this show out. At the very least it seems interesting. Your opinions are noted though and I like this video. Thanks for posting.
Youre so right mate. Sadly we are living in a world where everything is rushed in the quest for money as an excuse for  shallowness. At least I hope it‚Äôs not just incompetence or stupidity.
Im enjoying the series, I&#39;ve read the books and played and the games. I&#39;m also a huge fan of Hellboy, DC and LOTR and understand that they change things when adapting for screen. Some of the changes are strange but I find it more enjoyable then knowing exactly what&#39;s going to happen from reading the books.
Honestly the whole show is a mess, it‚Äôs not terrible, but it is a mess, but it‚Äôs got so much potential to be good. The story is all over the place I hope they have a more concentrated story next season. Yennefer, Triss and Fringilla are completely miscast, CGI looks incredibly cheap, there is poor acting all around apart from Henry Cavill.
To me, this doesn&#39;t really come across as a review, it comes across more as a direct comparison between the show and the books. I understand that everyone has their opinion and whatnot, but it seems to me that you came into this wanting to dislike it. You didn&#39;t really even review the show, you just compared and contrasted specific parts with the books; had I not watched the show, I would have absolutely no idea what happened. I&#39;m not hating on you or saying that you&#39;re wrong or anything, but this just seems mischaracterized as a review of the show&#39;s first season. That said, I appreciate the care you put into this video and the obvious love you have for the Witcher, and thus you have gained a subscriber.
Bro word of advice grow some balls in life doesn‚Äôt matter how good you do you‚Äôll disappoint or disatisfy people for no damn reason and its not you its them be unapologetic cause you‚Äôre walking on eggshells with your fans and if you learned anything from the books thats not very Geralt like...
Anyone wondering about the Nilfgaardian armor:<br><br>The showrunner and writers wanted to make a real world political statement towards &quot;the patriarchy and toxic masculinity&quot;. That is why Nilfgaard is portrayed as fanatical bad (white) guys with armor that&#39;s meant to look like male genitalia. Ballsack armor with helmet that is supposed to look like the tip of... Well. You can imagine.<br><br>That&#39;s why there are so many actors of color in the show. Granted, every actor did a good job with the material they had.
In my opinion (as someone that read the books and learned about the lore of the games) you pointed out a lot of what i thought of the show as well even if i was pleasantly surprised by Henry Cavill&#39;s performance which i found pretty good i also loved Jaskier which was like i remembered him (also where&#39;s his hat with the feather?). I think however that they should have read the part where they describe Ciri because il the show she&#39;s just a young blonde girl whereas in the books they very well describe her with Grey hair (not blonde) and with eyes that look like huge emeralds (with COLOUR). Also, they didn&#39;t get how Ciri was behaving in the beginning because she was like &quot;i&#39;m gonna call my mommy and she&#39;ll take your head off&quot; and not this brave girl like in the show. And one of the main drawbacks i think is how they totally RUINED the golden dragon story. It was rushed through and the dragons were ugly as fuck (fucking hell poor Borch they said he was the most beautiful). Also, ballsack nilfgaard armor. I have a lot of other things to say but my comment&#39;s long enough xD
I feel like the actor who is playing king foltest would make for a good bloody baron. Any thoughts on this?
I just want to see geralt fight scenes  everything else is not witcher  but fight scenes are cool
Your in too deep!  Fanatics never enjoy anything.
The one thing that makes this serials failed is how they creating the  atmosphere and the world of the witcher. I still can&#39;t feel the world and get into it.
Stop excusing yourself for your opinion. Excuse me excuse me excuse me.... STOP IT!
Hmmmm...I remember in the books there was Dara in Brokilon forest before Ciri meets Geralt....not sure if he was an efl though....
I hear you! I just can&#39;t disconnect from the books :(
I have read the books, and I like them, and you&#39;re allowed to dislike this show of course. But I feel like most of your issues just come from &quot;It&#39;s different from the books&quot;. It&#39;s not gonna be 100% accurate to the books and it&#39;s probably not gonna line up with the games in the end either, it&#39;s its own thing, so I&#39;d instead judge the decisions they&#39;ve made in season 1 by how it pays off in following seasons. Game of Thrones season 2 forward goes away from the books¬¥ path quite a bit as well, but that was amazing up until Season 5 and some of 6.
Netflix The Witcher is so lame and booooringgg.... You should hire Greg <br>Yaitanes and Jonathan Tropper because they really did a good job in the <br>Cinemax Bashee series.
You don&#39;t have to justify why you don&#39;t like somthing we come here for your content and your opinion this is your channel after all üòÄ
I think you‚Äôre pretty spot on with your review.  I like the show, everything with Geralt in it is good. Story wise, it‚Äôs pretty weak though. Yeah, there is nothing believable about Ciri and Geralts bond for the ending hug.
starts at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=1m45s"">1:45</a> / <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=24m35s"">24:35</a>
I Believe Act of Gerald is really Hard i too agree with you bro i too don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s played
I think you shouldn&#39;t mind upsetting people. <br>I personally would apreciate it if you made a &quot;nitpicking &quot; video as i am curious about the Lore. i know i could just go watch your other videos to learn, but it would be nice to put things in contrast. just casting my vote.
Finally everything I was thinking on video üëèüëè
I&#39;m thankful the show was even made, even more so that it&#39;s good. But screw it for not having all the depth or nuance of the books. Shame on you Netflix .. <br><br>I&#39;m being sarcastic in the latter sentences
I honestly don&#39;t mind a somewhat altered retelling of the story. I&#39;ve read the books, I&#39;ve enjoyed the books, I don&#39;t really want to see the exact same story play out in live action, what&#39;s the point of that? If anything my major gripes with the show is some clunky and hamfisted dialogue, ironically I found some of the cringiest dialogue to be some of the lines that were lifted directly from the books. <br><br>I do agree with the Brokilon scenes feeling pointless though. Ciri walks in, hangs out with the Dryads (who could have definitely done with more make-up/prosthetics to make them look more like otherworldly plant people and less like just human women with dreadlocks), drinks the water, sees a magic tree, and leaves. <br><br>I quite liked exploring Yennefers origin, felt like those were actually the strongest, most interesting scenes. In no small part to a really great performance by Anya Chalotra. And yes I&#39;m also with you when it comes to changing up Fringillas story that drastically, that did really make no sense. But actually getting to see the battle at Sodden Hill was exquisite! All in all, it turned out stronger than expected in my humble opinion.
I&#39;ve read the books and played the Witcher games but I still really enjoyed the show. Yes, they changed some things, but so did so many other shows, even GOT. What&#39;s the point of game, books and show being the same? Then you wouldn&#39;t need all 3. Also, you say that they invented a lot of stuff, so you mean to say that the games didn&#39;t invent anything? All the things in the games are purely canon and you can find them in the books? No, lol. This does really feel like you were ready to hate on the show before it even started
30% of why you dont like the show &amp; 70% of you apologizing. Stop being sorry for what you believe, man
Dandelion&#39;s modern pop singing is complete immersion-breaking horsesh**t, just like several other poorly delivered aspects that play out like a low-budget drama club project. Henry can&#39;t hold the whole production up on his own. Excellent swordplay in a few scenes though. Lightyears from LOTR/GOT.1-5 quality in every element.
It was crap!!!üò•.....very disappointing.....poor acting....costumes?...expected more, considering big Henry is being paid a fortune for each episode.<br>Why set out to confuse your paying audience?.... think I&#39;ll watch a rerun of G.O T üëç
do it
The show is a solid C. Nothing more. Nothing less.
This video is giving me flashbacks to insufferable Game of Thrones book fans.
I actually watched the whole season with the mind set of it being something entirely different to the game and books. It was ok, the minor changes didnt really both me, even the way some stories were played out completely different but the whole vilgerfortz thing just kept bothering me as well as the whole sacrificing things to use magic bs. I really lost interest in the battle of sodden cause of the way that things played out. I mean your black triss might even be dead before season 2. I just hope that swapkowski&#39;s deal with cdpr actually translates to them influencing the show production in the future. still gonna watch next seasons anyway
I know it can be difficult to adjust when a book is adapted for tv/movie, and it has to be doubly so when there are also games based around the character.<br> I personally never had the time to play thru much of the game and never happened to pick up the books. <br>For me the show was quite good, and all of my gripes have have nothing to do with it not matching up with it&#39;s source material.<br><br><br>edit: Although Lord of the Rings is a good example. I read all the book before the movies came out. I absolutely hate the movies for what they changed. TOM BOMBADIL I&#39;LL NEVER FORGET YOU!!!!
Damn, with all of that build up at the beginning, I actually thought you were gonna say you like the show and that was the opinion you&#39;re being wary about. Lmao
I wish you would stay by your convictions. I understand you have a platform that acts as your livelihood but having your own opinion on something doesn&#39;t require an apology. It&#39;s called criticism. If people don&#39;t like your video they won&#39;t watch it, so you don&#39;t have to constantly apologise to them. If people get offended that&#39;s their problem. Offense is subjective for gods sake. It just makes you sound wishy washy and the effort you take to please everyone means that you please no one as you don&#39;t take any risks. In my opinion, the show is terrible and I would happily watch a video you make taking this apart. The acting is wooden. The writing is awful. Whoever was in charge of editing was clearly asleep. So disappointed in the show.
My 2 cents if anyone cares:<br>I&#39;ve read all books (but it&#39;s been a long time) and played all games. I enjoyed the show generally but the points you make bothered me as well. Especially the Ciri story felt very off and vilgefortz and kahir where so weird. I didn&#39;t hate yens story but it wasn&#39;t great. I loved Henry cavill and I feel he portrayed geralt perfectly. The costume design was horrible on most characters and for some reason geralt has grey hair. But without a doubt the worst idea was not developing the cire/geralt relationship. The most important thing in the books imo.
Book purist. That&#39;s all you had to say. You&#39;re a book purist. Not a bad thing. We saw this with Game of Thrones too. Book purist rarely like the screen adaptations. My thoughts are, I have 3 different versions of The Witcher to enjoy. I&#39;ve enjoyed the games. I&#39;ve really enjoyed the show. I&#39;m sure I will enjoy the books as well as I get started on them after xmas. <br><br>Also... Harden up dude. If people don&#39;t like your opinion that&#39;s not your problem and nothing that warrants an apology.
I can guarantee only 19 of you here have ever read more than 3 pages of any witcher book. The rest of us have only played witcher 3.
It also annoys me that so many things are different but I quite enjoy the show. I mean it‚Äôs netflix, I didn‚Äôt hope that the history would be exactly the same as in the books.
I only have one question based on something you said - that you can take the games as canonical sequels to the books. How can the first game be considered canonical when they obliterate the lore within the first 5 seconds of chapter 1 of the game with Alvin being an activated carrier of Elder Blood when it flat out states in the books that only females can be an activated carrier? The other games (despite the glaring changes they made in general - Signs being a big one), maybe, but the first? I can&#39;t see that being the case.  <br><br>Also I enjoyed the show myself and that&#39;s as someone who played all three games and am 5 books into the full series of 7 if you include the first two sets of short stories. I just took it as an alternate telling of the stories much like the MCU is an alternate telling of the Marvel characters. Daredevil&#39;s story wasn&#39;t 100% out of the comics but it did a good enough job of telling Matt Murdoch&#39;s story. Same with this, at least in my opinion. I agree with some of the points you made and I wouldn&#39;t mind a nit-picking video where you go over all the changes to the individual stories. <br><br><br>Lastly - you got a new subscriber despite our difference in opinions on the show.
I agree with you and feel the same. I hoped that they get the lore right, but they just made unnecessary changes and then ruined it for me... But I do not say that it is utter pudding... Because at the same time I can see how awesome it is at times and why people like it. Henry is good as Geralt and keeps improving I think. I wonder what is he thinking about the changes? Because he said he read the books. Would be nice to hear his truthful opinion!
I appreciate the fuck out of you dude. I like the show for entertainment value not necessarily for lore accurate representation. Dont stop doing what you do.
I wonder why they didn&#39;t reach out to you to work with them on the show and get red cd Projekt also and the orginal writer. And make the best adaptation possible
I feel like anybody coming Into this show without knowing anything would feel confused as the way the story jumps back and forth in time. Of the three people I asked who had no reference for the show, that was their biggest complaint.  The heavy use of contacts on characters eyes was sort of jarring. Yennifer‚Äôs looked fairly natural but Ciri, Geralt and Yennifers boyfriend (forgot his name) all looked fake AF and left the characters with these weird looking creepy staring eyes with a fixed pupil. Also I‚Äôd imagine that they could have used CG for coloring eyes and making them look far more natural. I know it‚Äôs a random thing to complain about but it kept bothering me. Anybody losing their mind about George not liking it is the problem with people these days. Just because somebody doesn‚Äôt like something you do doesn‚Äôt mean they are wrong. It‚Äôs like the world is full of 15 year olds trying to justify what they like so they can feel validated. Great job George, Keep up the killer Videos!
I&#39;ve read the books and played the games, I still enjoyed the show. I didn&#39;t go into it with the expectation that they&#39;d be giving me a representation of the books, I went into it with the thought that they were going to do their own thing. In so far as making a lot of changes, that&#39;s kind of what you have to do in that case. They have to build their own world, with their own story (sort of). However, there is quite a lot I don&#39;t like nevertheless. Among those the casting choices for both Yennefer and Triss, the rushed way that Geralt and Ciri meet (including the overly dramatic hug that didn&#39;t feel earned at all), and the time jumping wasn&#39;t confusing to me whatsoever but my friend who had only ever played Witcher 3 a few years ago was completely lost. <br><br><br>I didn&#39;t really like any plot point that took us away from Geralt&#39;s story as I think they should&#39;ve kept this first season all about him but I didn&#39;t much mind the liberties that they took. It did take away from the mystery of the world somewhat but all the more reason to read the books, right? The one positive I really have for the show is that whether you like it or not, you now have another reason to read the books.
my question: if you forget the books and the game, as something completely new, would the show be considerate good or not?
Thank you for your honest review.  I feel like of like you are acting as an expert historian in this particular arena.  You have extensive evidence-based opinions that you are sharing both because you were disappointed in the show and because you feel there is a knowledge deficit amongst some viewers that might validate your position.  You explained yourself well in this review; so, both your opinions and your reasons for them are clearly valid.  <br><br><br>I personally liked the show.  I have not read the books, although my husband has.  He also greatly enjoyed the games.  This grants me a sort of moderate exposure to the cannon material without being tied to it which prevents me from being disturbed by the changes.  <br><br><br>I will just say this about differences in general for adaptations.  If you know everything that is going to happen and cannon is followed explicitly, then the story is basically a cover.  And, most song covers are lacking.  I completely agree that it is the wrong tact, to change the nature and tone of invested characters (ie ones that fans KNOW well enough to engage with).  Similarly, it is also normal for a readers, viewers, and players to create enhanced mental backstory for any sort of plot they engage with.  When these various subconscious explanations are denied and discredited by newly released cannon material, it often leads to dissatisfaction.  This is specifically why prequels fail so much.  Prequels try to create new content within the very defined limits of known cannon.  The first Witcher season is basically a prequel.  It is trying to play the same song but give it a fresh feel...  like the cyberpunk version of Country Roads.
What i am going to say is not an opinion,or rather a generalised statement of the perspective of a show runner.Imagine to adapt 550 pages ,to bring the world to life with high production of CGI for monsters,magic and so on...plus to remove inconsistencies,unexplained sequences and adding backstories so that viewer can actually feel connection with addition scenes in just 8 hours.What people dont understand is that,its easy to write a book with lines like &quot;there came a monster with the size of a mountain with two horns that spit fire,it ate lightning &quot; its easy to write similar lines like these but its hard to produce them,brig them to life ,which costs lot of <a href=""http://money.so/"">money.So</a> fundamentally do not try to expect any series to add everything from the books,its <a href=""http://stupid.to/"">stupid.To</a> bring life to a single paragragh in the books includes location,some effects,costumes,actors,cgi and so on.And to imagine they brought two books of witcher to life is itself amazing.
It has it&#39;s problems the only thing that kept bothering me was black Fringilla Vigo she kept dragging me out of the show I hate when people take existing characters and change their skin color
For Luke, I think what they did was horrible and went heavily away from the Extended Universe. To me the EU is the true canon.
I hope it goes well, but given the writers and some questionable costume design. I have my doubts.
I understand your perspective on the series. I looked at it as a witcher based series and went into it with an open mind. There were many issues I saw in the series but putting it aside I thoroughly enjoyed it.
You are one annoying individual... complaining about changes compared to books and yet having no problem with games which invented a lot of things compared to books.
Instead of repeating yourself over and over again you could have just made a 5 minute video.
Name one book that a TV show or movie did&#39;nt fuck up ???
A book and video game don&#39;t transfer to a good Netflix show. The shows intent is to make a popular Witcher story, not retell word for word half a dozen books. It would be off putting for those who haven&#39;t read the book to get every angle offered in a very niche book. It&#39;s like the MCU, some stories work better in comic book form and won&#39;t transfer well to the big screen. If they titled the Witcher off of the books directly you would have a point. However, the writer himself said that everything outside of the books is an adaptation and not directly rewriting or effecting the books.
I got some real Donkey and Shrek vibes when watching the scenes with Dandelion and Geralt.
I don&#39;t think child Geralt was done just to build up the drama between him and his mom, because nearly the entirety of the episode he was in a delusional state.<br>Regardless, the series is based on the books its not a direct translation, it wouldn&#39;t work like that.
To be honest I luv the show it‚Äôs an 8/10, I did find it weird how the add the Yenn backstory but honestly didn‚Äôt mind. The fact is it a show and the probably want to answer the question  and add something to her and didn‚Äôt just want her to pop up OP for no reason. <br>But all in all I‚Äôm just a lover of the game and never read the book so I‚Äôm a normie in that aspect. I respect ur opinion and understand how u free, kinda like how ppl read manga and then there any anime adaptations which ended up not what the manga reader expected. Poor analogy I know ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòè
Haven‚Äôt read the books but played The Witcher wild hunt, great RPG. As for the tv series...Back and forth from end to beginning etc etc. wtf! Hard to follow and at times bloody boring. Great costumes and settings but the story and directing?..well could have been a lot better i feel.
Criticism is spot on tbh. I was like &quot;why they gotta do my boy Cahir like that?&quot; people forget or don&#39;t know that he was essentially sent on a suicide mission to retrieve Ciri or else he and his family would be murdered.<br><br><br>Also, I preferred CDPRs version of Cahir aesthetic wise.
I &#39;ve played the games. It was a journey. Then I&#39;ve listened to audio books. It was another journey, the same in essence,different in taste. Then I&#39;ve read the books and somehow it was another journey, I made different accents, saw another cool moments I missed last time. And them I&#39;ve wathced the show. And it was another story. Different in the look, but the same in the essence. I like changes, I like different interprentations, I don&#39;t want the same soup everytime. That&#39;s why I liked the show and all the changes it made. <br><br><br><br>I think you won&#39;t get much hate for this video. Somehow most people, who liked the show, respect even negative opinions. Sword of destiny has two edges.
i do think that cavill looks a lot like geralt or at least what i picture when i think of him. so good job on that one
I am very much a fan of your lore videos, so I do get where you&#39;re coming from.<br>But the first casualty of any literary work that gets made into a movie or tv series is the established lore. Characters get removed or mashed together situations get altered for either time, director/showrunners narrative or visual effects reasons (don&#39;t get me started on the dragons)<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong I definitely have issues with the shows pacing and timeframe jumps, but is likely the best interpretation of The Witcher we are ever likely to see on screen.
This guys a clown how can you expect them to make every single thing accurate
Lol a dude who bases his whole life on a single video game of course is gonna be way to anal about every little stupid fuckin thing this dude prolly look like a bird
One of the major flaw of this show is there are no transitioning. One day nilfgard was a laughing stock of the others kingdom and all of a sudden they became OP overnight. Character development is quite bad too. People sleeping with each other in first encounter and fake emotion appear out of nowhere. Makes the whole thing looks fake. Henri Canville is the only thing holding everything together, but the retard who wrote the script messed Geralt up too. For a character who&#39;s supposed lack emotions he threw a huge tantrum like a baby.
I feel like the only reason they changed Cahir was to give the season a &quot;main villain&quot;. Idk why else they would do this whole story with him. I definitely wasn&#39;t a fan of the doppler story and killing off Moussack. I was super mad about that. I definitely get a lot of your opinions.
Can&#39;t wait for cyber punk 2077!
I agree with this  100 percent. It&#39;s nice to see the witcher as a show but not what I expected. And I kinda had a feeling they were gonna screw some things up, but I mean I&#39;ll watch it anyway for the fact that it has geralt doing his thing as a witcher in general between the combat scenes and the monsters other than that I do agree that the yennefer story is misleading that threw me off. As Well as the ciri story. And of course the nilfgardian ballsack armor is hideous  there I said it. üòÖ
I personally love things being explored that aren‚Äôt expanded on in a book...as long as it‚Äôs done well and I think it was done well
Stand up for yourself and your opinions! I doubt that I will agree based on what I know so far, I was saving the show for Christmas and haven‚Äôt watched yet. I‚Äôm also not nearly as invested as you either, my reference comes only from Witcher 3 game. You should actually take solace in the show coming as close as it does to the books and learn to appreciate them as separate entities. The Bourne movies didn‚Äôt have a single scene from the books. Nor did Starship Troopers and I could go on with dozens of other examples of books I‚Äôve loved that had completely different movie or tv adaptations that I love equally. On that note, I must give a kudos to the screenwriter for the original Jurassic Park! The movie was the closest adaptation of a book I‚Äôve ever seen.
For people griping just enjoy ya got it on screen
I agree with everything you said.<br>I didn&#39;t like the first season of this adaptation either, but I respect the opinions of those who do.  <br><br>In retrospect, there were some elements that I liked: the performances of Cavill and MyAnna Buring, music and a handful of the costume designs.<br><br> My greatest gripes are: the comparison to GOT. Whether or not you are a fan of GOT, you must admit that D&amp;D did an excellent job at adapting Martin&#39;s saga, but fell short when they were forced to create their own narrative; the Witcher is lackluster/mediocre in comparison. Second gripe is the god awful acting by the supportive cast, particularly Triss and Yen...Jesus H Christ. Third is the writing-- poorly done. <br><br>The show is quite young, as such, it should be given time to flourish.  Hopefully the showrunner won&#39;t let the success of the series get to her head thus preventing improvements.
Hey, you&#39;re entitled to your opinion. I played the games religiously, but I haven&#39;t read the book. I don&#39;t like some aspects in the series, yes, especially how the Niflgaardians are depicted. But that said, I love the series. Despite how it grossly differed in how I originally imagined it, the show is something I enjoy a lot.<br><br>Maybe because I am not really bothered by other interpretation that made the series. It just is.<br><br>Anyway, thank you for sharing what you think of it.
I like how he took 5 min to explain he is a dh.<br>Witcher has been his life for the last 2 years. Ha ha ha ha <br>Definition of a virgin nerd
the part where Geralt suddenly slaughters Renfri&#39;s gang out of the blue has no substance or impact... and newcomer will have zero clue why he did it. For many people the Lesser Evil was a favorite chapter precisely because of the REASON why Geralt had to kill... yet here he is being portrayed as a random douche that had LSD sex with a girl and suddenly wakes up deciding he wanna chop some motherfuckers up at a market.
The relationship between Geralt and Dandelion is completely lost in the show. In the book they were having a lot of comical fun together and Geralt was much more human and relatable as a person when he&#39;s around Dandelion... and he does appreciate Dandelion&#39;s company. While in the show he&#39;s just acting like your typical cowboy loner Hollywood Clint Eastwood I don&#39;t need nobody type... it&#39;s jarring how anyone can call Cavill&#39;s portrayal of Geralt as perfect. I guess some muscles and abs and sword skills totally make up for other subtleties.
BOOK:<br><br>‚ÄòYou&#39;ve finally found me! Oh, Geralt! I waited all this time! Yes, a terribly long time... We&#39;ll stay together now, won&#39;t we? Now we&#39;ll be together, right? Say it, Geralt! Forever! Say it!‚Äô<br><br>‚ÄòForever, Ciri.‚Äô<br><br>‚ÄòYes, just like they said! Geralt! Like they said... Am I your destiny? Say it! Am I your destiny?‚Äô<br><br>‚ÄòYou&#39;re something more, Ciri. Something more.‚Äô<br><br>SHOW:<br><br>&quot;WhO iS yeNeFeR????!!!223&quot;
I think nilfgard like all Norse likeness (nifleheim) connotes evil or empire like all nations looked at Rome or England later. The glance we get at nilfgard is through the fearful kingdoms of the north. As nilfgard does not bow to as much religion and looks to go for truth over morality. Meaning if they have to use human sacrifices to reach a goal it‚Äôs wrong not to go after that truth.<br>Geralt always has to be a neutral but even in the books deep down he has a big heart <br>And as long as they get geralt right I can live with the other stuff.<br>Yenns journey parallels geralts as they are almost killed for not being wise or careful- yen I‚Äôm not following the respect of the magic she wishes to control and geralt letting his guard down after reaching sunrise just bc she had only the agility and strength of a small girl she was still a beast in her mind
Personally i enjoyed the show, i have read the books and yes they did make some odd decisions regarding plot, but i did enjoy Yennifer&#39;s story line, i hated some of the cast choices especially Triss, overall i&#39;m looking forward to season 2 as its already been green lit. Keep up the great work with your channel :)
Thank you for your honest opinion, i absolutely agree with you.
I feel like the idea is geralt was made into a mutant and yen was a mutant made into someone ‚Äúnormal‚Äù which they both find unsatisfying
I think you nailed it with your first criticism. I‚Äôm only two episodes in but you‚Äôre exactly right: it feels like they used the characters and events of the Witcher world to make a bog standard fantasy show. It doesn‚Äôt feel new or different. It doesn‚Äôt have that blunt but mature personality that the books and games have. It just feels like everything else out there right now
The whole pacing and placement was off for me. They would switch between past and present without stating so, which is just confusing.
I love the whole witcher world and lore but when i watched the show i couldnt keep watching it because of all the forced &quot;diversity&quot; in it and it kept keeping me out of it... I agree with you on Geralt, henry cavil did a good job and the battles in it were cool but not enough for me to keep watching just felt ruined to me... And i agree with you on all the lore changes pissed me off... Dont apologise for having a different opinion
I have nothing against any person&#39;s opinion, but this is what I have experienced so far in book-to-film adaptation... Every show needs to be EXACTLY copied from their fave books.
You‚Äôre probably losing a lot of viewers with these super long disclaimers at the start of your videos. Just have confidence in yourself, man
I didn&#39;t read the books, but I played Witcher 1,2 and 3. The Netflix show is okay IMO, need more monsters action and MAGIC!
When watching the show I just assumed vilgefortz lost the fight on purpose
I understand exactly what you feel. I adore the books and the game hints at the books but is really a story after the books.<br><br>I felt it was really hard to introduce these 3 main characters of the over arching story of itlienes prophecy inevitably comes.<br>We have all 3 fighting destiny = death to acceptance <br>Even queen calanthe in away. I<br><br>It was absolutely amazing slowly realizing all these things were happening at different times and how throughout time and no matter what choice is made these 3 are drawn back to each other.<br><br>This lays a precedence. When I heard Craig on Caite was one of the suitors to pavetta having knowledge that geralt and him would be in a battle for yennifer. So many possibilities as the series goes forward as time is not an issue in this series.<br>Showing all 3 go through their own trail of grasses in their lives was an excellent way to show how intertwined they are. Did geralts wish create this or did their connection create geralts wish. As yen was already bored and offered some diversion that geralt turned down bc he liked her and the idea that he loved renfri was also beautiful <br><br>I can‚Äôt believe critics felt this episode dragged- geralt having no loyalty to the sorcerer had to kill the first woman he had feeling for in a long time
Oh, c&#39;mon, don&#39;t be such a book prude. I agree with most of your points, but it is still better than expected.<br>L.E. Read the damned LotR books, mate. And thank me later.
First video of yours that I have seen but I gatta say, you are totally entitled to your opinion and you have done your homework, clearly, so I appreciate your knowledgeable take. Secondly, don&#39;t worry about what people are saying about your disposition on your videos. I played the games and read the books but I still just enjoyed seeing Geralt&#39;s adventures again, despite having some deep changes. Anyways, DO YOU, SON! Keep up the content.
I actually plan to re-read the books after finishing season 1 because I felt like there was something weird with the series that just did not appeal to me like the books and games did. Certain parts just didn&#39;t feel/look/sound right - but I just couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong.<br><br>And I think your review might have just cleared my doubts.
Im sorry dude :(
His video good but he talks sht about show but will prob watch it 5+ times
I listened to the audiobooks 1 and a half times and I played the games Witchers 2 &amp; 3. (I figured that I would note my credentials for proper judgement just out of fairness).
So if the author himself was ok with the changes why would you allow the changes to bother you THIS much?
Jesus Christ. You may as well just put in a tag to skip the first <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=1m40s"">1:40</a> with the title of &quot;Skip I have an opinion opening.&quot;<br>Review and thoughts pretty much indicate that there&#39;s opinions involved.
Show seems good just screen writer a idiot
Wat about the time jumps does that change anything?
I kinda felt the same yen scenes felt so boring without geralt and Yen and triss are ugly
never played the game, never read the books, but i thought this show was great and still better than the last season of game of thrones.
It&#39;s Yennefers show more than Geralt&#39;s
Yeah, I really thought the way Geralt and Ciri first met was special. In that forest, and how snotty Ciri acted, and all those things. I get them not wanting to cast a 4-6 yr old to play Ciri, but I wish the show runner hadn&#39;t been so set on making sure the &#39;strong female characters&#39; were established independent of Geralt. Yen is not a victim in the books. She&#39;s fucking powerful, and scary in a way. Yet, the show turned her into a victim, and I wasn&#39;t a big fan of that. <br>I thought the show got the tone pretty spot on. Dandelion was pretty perfect. And I think the show runner didn&#39;t care at all about Geralt. (she wanted him to be an occasional side character, and for the story to be about Ciri and Yen) but, Henry Cavel saved Geralt by already being a big fan of the books and the games, so he was able to keep Geralt true. <br><br><br>The show runner wanted to the show to be much more &#39;woke&#39; than it was, but some people sent by god himself saved it from belonging in the netflix trashfire of overwoke shows. Since the female characters in the source material are already strong and all that, the show messed with the story in order to separate them from Geralt. because for some reason having Geralt on screen with them weakens them or something. When the characters as introduced in the books were amazing. And Geralt never stole a scene from them in the books.
I watched the show with little to none knowledge of the witcher world and i enjoyed it so much. Every reveal is a treat and made me want to know more abt the world. <br>I think what you are feeling is the same with percy Jackson fan when they saw the movie.
&quot;I don&#39;t understand why this TV show isn&#39;t a book or video game&quot; Not really an opinion worth sharing.
The show is good to watch, and they do alter things to make it work as a TV show, to compare both stories, i will like the book better. Love what you do with your channel.
This guy is a melt I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve wasted my time watching this guys opinion. I get it he‚Äôs worked on it weekly for 2 years or whatever but you‚Äôre crying just because it‚Äôs not exactly the same as the book or how you want it. And stop waffling on about the same shit you made your point, weakly, over and over again
I&#39;m going to throw in my two cents because hey, why not. I actually quite enjoyed the show and expect it to improve  with subsequent seasons but there are some really annoying flaws. <br><br>1. I think my main issue came from the poor casting and poor acting and poor representation from the secondary characters. Henry Cavill absoloutely knocked it out of the park for me, and Yennefer and Ciri were pretty good to. The rest however were very lacking (a few notable exceptions being Queen Calanthe, Dandelion and Mousesack) and bordered on God awful. Triss&#39; actress was an extremely poor choice (and I sincerely doubt she could act her way out of paper bag). Vilgefortz too took a beating, the legendary prodigal mage getting his ass kicked by a regular man was fucking silly, nor was he a particular menacing person overall.<br><br>2. Inserting characters where they don&#39;t belong. Geralts battle with the Striga should&#39;ve been the first episode imo. It introduces us to the world, how people view witchers, and Geralts character in general as he goes beyond the call of duty to do the right thing. But most importantly, that Geralt was truly alone. That being said, Triss should not have been in the episode and I have no idea what the wtiters were thinking by including her.<br><br>3.  The large battles and magic. The small scale combat is amazing, Geralts fights often being a highlight, but the full out battles were tragic. Sodden Hill in particular was pretty bad (can anyone really say thats how they pictured it in their head?).  The CG was distractingly shit when it came to the portrayal of magic or when they needed to show full out war. That being said, I can understand not having GoT levels with a substantially smaller budget.<br><br>Thanks for reading through my little rant, feel more than free to call me out on anything. Like I said, I actually enjoyed the show but know that these bits can be improved on.
If you want a carbon copy of the books / games go play the games and read the books. Of course they‚Äôre going to change things for tv
Having read the books and completed all 3 games personally I find the adaptation is close enough. I was a pretty hardcore Song of Ice and Fire fan who saw the Game of Thrones series take a massive shit on the source material. With that as a reference I enjoyed the adaptation. Just a personal opinion.
I liked the show generally, but as a book reader everything that was changed rang alarms in my head and it made it hard to just ignore. Like I hate the portrayal of Foltest, Cahir, the Dryads, Fringilla, Triss and the Nilfgaardians ffs what the hell did they do to Nilfgaard? Nilfgaard isn‚Äôt evil at all they are just an expansionist nation and they are even more tolerant than the Northern Realms. And they kept hammering the stupid ass DESTINY idea. And MAGIC dear god wtf happened to the magic why is magic so stupidly weak in the show, in the books magic is unbelievably powerful and basically trumps everything else and rightfully so considering the sacrifices necessary to gain magical knowledge.
I think they blew their budget on Henry Cavil and that&#39;s why we couldn&#39;t see mages doing magic or a golden dragon dueling a noble night.
I agree that changed a lot  and some stuff is dumb but i think some of it was done to give the people who are new to witcher some understanding of characters  in more of a TV narrative
It&#39;s kinda sad that you have to apologise for your opinion of a show. I personally liked it but I can see your points. But I also think that because of the fact that you are so into the lore ( because is your job and your life for this past 2 years) there won&#39;t be an adaptation in this format that can fulfill your expectations.
I don&#39;t agree with you at all, but you are entitled to your own opinion and that&#39;s fine. People should watch the show definently and perhaps they like it or not.<br>Of course I&#39;m sad that you don&#39;t like it and is a little negative about it, but this is an honest review and you know what you are taking about so I Respect your opinion even though I&#39;m not agreeing with you. Happy holidays
This is the problem with making books into video games, and movies/ tv shows. There are the fans that want to see a 100% faithful representation of the original material, which never happens. If you don&#39;t drop that expectation you won&#39;t enjoy it, if it veers too far off what you expect.<br><br>This show is &quot;The Witcher&quot; so far as specific named characters exist, and overarching themes are presented. This is why I rather enjoyed the show, I only know a little of the story, characters and themes as presented from Witcher 3. It looks, feels and seems to present itself well within its own universe.<br><br>I hope this show doesn&#39;t get cancelled.
The actress for Triss was absolutely god awful. Had to skip past the bits with her in
Embrace change bro. Relax and enjoy it for what it is. It&#39;s own thing. The books are still the books. And the show will take its own direction. Technically it&#39;s pretty well made :)
Casting is a diseaster. There were no dark skinned elves in the LORT just like in the books. Why it is so hard to stick to the source material???
I honestly though Henry was the best thing about the show
Also I think your problem was that you didn&#39;t expect anything to be changed and everything had to be like in the books, you had to be more open mind about it and see if the show can stands by itself (Like every form of art needs) and as a guy who hasn&#39;t read the books, I liked it, I think it stands on it&#39;s own. Hope you open your mind a bit more for season 2 as you already know they are taking liberties with the show :)
I&#39;m 3 episodes in and I&#39;m loving it so far
Explanation to why Vilgefortz didn&#39;t kill Cahir (Spoiler!):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Vilgefortz didn&#39;t really try to kill Cahir because he already sided with Nilfgaard. He just wanted to still seem loyal.
I like the series. To me who knows the witcher by the witcher 3 only this feels similar to the Witcher universe. There were some changes that I didn&#39;t like like some character changes and the concept of magic. I understand you who gose by the books and the game and by some youtube videos for lore. I can see your problem of how some changes are not like in the book and I who havent read a single book can see the expectations. Although it nice of the characters to develop on thier own not going by the books or game can challenge that. I never understood the game until I played it and wanting to know more about got me interested in the witcher in the first place.
So you been a Witcher fan for 2 years, lol, SMH.
I personally loved the show even watched it back to back  binging it trying to see things or hear things i might&#39;ve missed at first, I honestly have never played any of the games or read the books so maybe that plays a role in my vague understanding of what you have stated in this video.<br>With that being said is it fair to compare this show to that of  &quot; A story being told through generations, someone told someone&quot;<br>and in time the story being told had changed details even lost facts and was adapted differently then when it was first told.<br>That&#39;s how I see the show, its a telling from  a different source that heard of the witcher and showed us what they heard etc.<br>I&#39;m glad atleast you can have room to accept the series to some degree, even if small, I think it&#39;ll grow on you.
I didn&#39;t even read the books, only played the game, and i thought the show was pretty fricking awful with all the whole 3 different stories with different timelines and the rushed out scenes that felt so artificial, specially the dragon episode.<br>And the ending didnt rly felt like an ending, i thought there was gonna be at least 2 more episodes after that, until it ended lol<br>But the show did do something good for the witcher series, it made me want to buy the book and see how good it actually is after seeing this sorry excuse of an adaptation.<br>At least Geralt was good in it
As someone who has never played the game or read the books, I think the show is great. Just remember the show is <b>based</b> on the source material, not a direct copy.
Title should be, The Witcher Books/Game in comparison to the Show - would‚Äôve saved that whole intro and 6 mins of my life lol
George, don&#39;t be a pussy. Don&#39;t ever apologize for having an opinion and don&#39;t cater to those that get upset really easily.<br><br>Stop apologizing. It&#39;s obnoxious.
I absolutely agree with your critique. Plot changes were made in every little story, every little encounter and the sad thing for me is not the fact that they decided to make changes but that these changes just dumb down everything to the point of pointlessness. Watching the series I have countless times asked myself ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. Why change it like that? So much inspiration was readily available for them to create their own little twists and new stories but they completely blew it. I‚Äôm just baffled. They took an incredible book series with an amazing games adaptation and created a forgettable fantasy series I wouldn‚Äôt care about at all if it wasn‚Äôt called the Witcher. People praising the show are a mystery to me. I can‚Äôt grasp that opinion.
I really liked Henry Cavil as Geralt. He truly sold me on his performance as our beloved Witcher with my favorite parts from episode 3 when he goes on a side quest to clear a Witcher contract. Yennefer&#39;s story however, I found to be mostly boring and I didn&#39;t feel she had much chemistry with our hero Geralt. Finally I found Ciri&#39;s story the worst, I wasn&#39;t sold on her Character at all and her storyline was made worst by being told out of chronological order from the others.
It&#39;s alright. A solid 7.5/10, nothing special in my opinion. Nowhere near as good as Game of Thrones to be honest
As someone who only played W3, I saw many book-readers being satisfied with the netflix series (which doesn&#39;t make much sense to me now, hearing all the differences there were), so it was really interesting to hear your mini essay on all the inaccurate/embellished parts of the show vs the book. This type of video comparing between the two is exactly the type of review I love to see. Straight comparison of plot changes, rather than bagging on &#39;forced diversity&#39; or other pettier criticisms. <br><br><br>While I feel bad that you felt the need to have the disclaimer at the beginning, i think it was well said and well delivered, knowing how toxic people are nowadays with their own opinions. Thank you for this!!
You have verbalised alot of the complaints I had whilst watching the show. So many things were changed without reason that I can&#39;t get past. If people enjoy it more power to them, but I can&#39;t recommend it in its current state
Just wanna talk about the point you made about the show presenting Fringilla as the saviour of Nilfgaard. That‚Äôs actually incorrect, it was the white flame/Emhyr who took the throne and made Nilfgaard better. Other than that I respect your learned opinion :)
I like the show, haven&#39;t read the books but played through all the witcher games. After watching your video I totally respect your opinion and defenitly understand why you disliked the show.
Yennefer&#39;s story and the Aretuza bits were my favorite parts of the show honestly. Anya as Yenn was amazing, the sorceresses in-general were my favorite characters. MyAnna as Tissaia  was phenomenal as well. Excited to see how Yenn&#39;s and Triss&#39; relationship is portrayed in the show going forward.
Honestly I couldn&#39;t watch to much of this show. 2 episodes in and I was already confused feeling like there was no real world building I felt like to understand anything I would have had to play the games or read the books before hand. History and Lore was just dumped and bulldozed in this show. they needed to take a different approach maybe by using the first 3 episodes to built one character and back story then move to the next then episode 4 bring it together. just the massive amount of info dump without knowing what it is referencing  to ( because again I do not play the games or read the books) was just to much. And Man i really liked your review but it kind of showed my point in your review you said you went back and relooked at lore and everything before watching and in your review I got lost just about as much as I got lost in the show with Lore dumps and history
While I agree and appreciate that everyone has the right to like or dislike something. This video was labelled as a review and the only criticism is that things are different compared to the books or games. You can&#39;t compare the show to something it isn&#39;t trying to be. They said right from the beginning when it was first announced that it wasn&#39;t going to be like the books or the game. They would take inspiration from those two but were creating something new. If you had other criticisms, great or If the video was &quot;why I didn&#39;t like the...&quot; it would be better.<br>Repeatedly right from the beginning you use words and phrases like &quot;that&#39;s wrong&quot; or &quot;untruthful&quot;, &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;half truths&quot; again this would be the case if they were trying to tell the same story but they were not. The only time this made sense was in the second half of the video when you were asking the question of whether the show is a good place to get more context for the books or the games however even then it&#39;s not &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;untruthful&quot; it&#39;s just different. I understand you personally couldn&#39;t detach yourself from the other material, that fine, and that as a result you didn&#39;t like the show, also fine, but the video gives off the impression the show makers were trying to make a faithful adaptation when in fact they have been very clear that this was something new. Essentially I suppose it&#39;s just a poor choice of words and if rephrased like &quot;i didn&#39;t enjoy the changes they made to this character&quot; or &quot;I preferred the portrayal of this part of the narrative in the books over this new narrative in a particular episode&quot;<br>I enjoyed your video so please don&#39;t think I&#39;m being overly critical, as you were critical of the show because it was different and have every right to be, I am just speaking my point of view. I love the Books and all the games, I study it&#39;s lore and anything else I can about the Witcher. I have been obsessed with it for years and years. Luckily I enjoyed the fact that the show is different. If I want to see a character I met in the books I read the books. If I miss a town or narrative string from the games I start playing. The same goes for the show, I just have another new version of the things I love. I dnt honestly know if I would of enjoyed it so much if it was more or less a retelling of stuff already covered, I have that already I dnt need it again. It&#39;s a shame you can&#39;t separate them and enjoy the show as I have especially as it seems like it&#39;s ur biggest issue with it but everyone is different.
Sapkowski who created this story is so balls deep into dimentia that he thinks the witcher is just his own whore whom he can pimp around to whoever pays more. cdpr are the only ones who actually care and if it weren&#39;t for them the witcher wouldn&#39;t have any market niche whatsoever in the first place and the only tv series on this material would be the Polish one, from the stone age just as bad as latest one.<br><br>Personally i managed to drag myself through it up until the begining of s1ep3, then i saw Triss&#39;s face and it was all over for me.
Must admit I came across your video by chance but I really like the way you put your points across. I enjoyed the series but I&#39;m very much a noob to the lore. I&#39;ve played witcher 3 and that&#39;s really the extent of my knowledge. The series has made me want to play the first two games and I&#39;ve just started that. But listening to your opinions has really peaked my interest in the books and overall lore. So I want to thank you and hope you keep up your good work
Your main criticisms are that it‚Äôs not identical to the books but it doesn‚Äôt need to be its its own show
What does everyone think of triss I like the actress and I love her powers but she‚Äôs definitely wrongly cast and fringilla actresses is the worst actresses ever! And corals actress all sorcerers are beautiful and coral was the ugliest in the most kindest way!
Where there any people of color in the books?
I LOVED THE FIRST 8 EPISODES!!!<br>I AM SO EXCITED TO WATCH THE NEXT ONES NEXT YEAR!!!<br>PERIOD AND MORE PERIODS!!!<br>you bet!!!
I was disappointed by the musical score for the show. The game musical is so much better. I know that probably not fair but the games music is so much better.
I&#39;ve been watching peoples reviews of the show and some of them have the same complaints as you do. They bring up the changes, some things that were taken away, and some things that were added unnecessarily. I do agree with some things that happen in the books, especially that they portray in the show, have changed and they do bug me a little. As you said, you&#39;ve been engulfed in The Witcher universe for the past couple years and so have I. I&#39;ve only read some of the books and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve only finished one of them. Were I to finish all the books, I don&#39;t think my opinion would change on how I feel about the show. I absolutely love it. Sure, some changes were made, but they have a reason for doing it. I don&#39;t think that it takes away in my personal opinion. If I were to have read all the books and notice a big or small change instantly, it would take me out of it, just as it did for you. They created this show for our enjoyment, and I believe that is what they are doing. I respect your opinion and the many others who have issues with the show because I know that they care. I have played The Witcher 3 and it is my favorite RPG of all time. I think if I read the books, played all the games all the way through, I would still love the show. I&#39;m glad you got to speak your mind. The people who created this show obviously love what Sapkowski did with the books and they feel it is a good idea to adapt it into the show and I wholeheartedly agree with them. The &quot;nitpicks&quot; and &quot;major or minor changes&quot; don&#39;t bother me because I love the world, characters, lore, setting and monsters so much. If I hated the changes, the enjoyment would be taken away from me, and I don&#39;t want that to happen because then I wouldn&#39;t want to watch the show, and I could never bring myself to do that because of the fact that I love it so much. I guess what I&#39;m basically saying is I&#39;m swallowing my pride and just enjoying more of The Witcher!
I&#39;ve read the stories, played all the games numerous times and have spent far too much of my life watching WitcherGeorge.  Personally I loved the series.  I think they did a beautiful job.  The acting was superb.  Cavill was the embodiment of Geralt.  So much so that there were a couple times when I thought I was watching a scene from the game.  MyAnna Buring as Tissaia, Joey Batey as Jaskier/Dandelion, and Jodhi May as Queen Calanthe mesmerized me each time they were on screen.  I didn&#39;t mind the time compression of the story.  It worked.  Yes the sets were often simple, like a theater play or (hint hint) like a video game.  If I had any complaint at all, its that Triss felt flat, but then I romanced her in every game.  The story pulls from the books, the setting pulls from the video games.  It&#39;s obvious that the people involved with the writing, directing, producing are also immense fans of the Witcher, and it shows.  I love how the story is broken into three parts.  I love how important and complete the women are ...not just gratuitous tits-n-ass.  I look forward to the next season!
I thought the show would be bad... but taken out of being directly compared to the greatest game of all time*... but I actually thinks it‚Äôs pretty good. I mean it‚Äôs Netflix, they could‚Äôve really. Reallllly fucked it up. I get why a hardcore fan wouldn‚Äôt like it though. I think the music is pretty damn good also, specially ‚Äòtoss a coin‚Äô.
I could have given it a pass if my second most hated character (yennefer&#39;) didn&#39;t eat a lot of the screen time unnecessarily
I actually quite liked seeing scenes like the bottle for Sodden hill and others that are only referred to in the books.
Overall I enjoyed the show, i just feel like not a lot happened and after a bit of time I realise that&#39;s because of all the sub plots that in the end don&#39;t effect the story. The doppler sub plot for example. That really could be removed entirely and nothing would change. They could have instead made room for more scenes with Geralt and Yen or something else entirely
Make a nitpick video and don&#39;t be so apologetic, you can&#39;t satisfy everyone
Dude, you actually liked  the Dandelion scenes. We have no common ground here, fuck off.
&quot;I&#39;ve just watched all episodes and it was great. You&#39;ve done a great job in showing there is no black or white in Wither&#39;s world. It&#39;s awesomes that your Nilfgaard is not just an empire of evil and your Fringilla looks even more intesting and complecated character than a book one&quot; - just read this comment sent to the showrunner on twitter. These are the observational skills of most viewers. They&#39;ll be pandered to. Buckle in.
I respect your opinion about the whole yennefer stuff however I don&#39;t agree.<br>Even though I it might not have been in the books I still think it fits well and it showed growth of a character trough struggle that Gerald can&#39;t provide since he is a flat character and the world reacts to him rather than vice versa
This is a goddamn GoT in they making, only this time the whole ship will sink all the sooner. They are building this series on a rotten foundation and those who enjoy the show now will come to hate it once the plot holes and misplaced character motivations come to the fore. The showrunners sacrificed subtlety and immersion for eyecandy and propaganda. This show mediocre Hollywood slop at best and has nowhere to go but down.
great Show ...never played the game ...read the books a while back...i have zero interest in the game
With all due respect, I know what you&#39;re saying is all the stuff they got wrong. However the show runner made it abundantly clear even though they&#39;re taking the source material from the books, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re copy &amp; pasting it into a different medium. The books is its standalone as are the games and now the series. Therefore they didn&#39;t get anything &quot;WRONG&quot; as this is the netflix take on the story which was said to be different before it started. Let&#39;s not forget that fact.
Nope you are just nit picking and biased, I win bye bye.
The golden dragon was actually modled as a wyvern. I got super pissed because the design wasnt a true dragon
I love the show by the way, i choose not to read the books just yet....because i would be doing and experiencing exactley the same what you are going through now. The show has to be different from the books, it&#39;s a different medium, and has it&#39;s own laws, it has to transform to be told by just image, and invoke emotions within us. It&#39;s possible, you&#39;ll might enjoy the story when you&#39;ll see it 10 years from now. And thank you for your video, it&#39;s fresh, and i like to hear you talk about the books and how you see them.You&#39;re pashion is very charming.
I look at as it as different Renditions but we know the source material is truth
They literally made Nilfgaard armor into dick and balls. I&#39;m not kidding. Wrinkly scrotum armor and dickhead helmet. This is a farce of a show.
The show has me wanting to read the books
The net picking video! We want that!
I really enjoyed the series but I guess it&#39;s like &quot;How to change your dragon.&quot; People love the film but omg it&#39;s basically a different story to the book
It‚Äôs a shame people are giving you grief for not liking it, it‚Äôs completely fair for you not too. It‚Äôs true they changed a great deal, I‚Äôm sure many others who love the books don‚Äôt like it either. I‚Äôve also read all the books and played all the games but I still really enjoyed the show. I fully expected them to change and expand on things especially because of the casting. I really didn‚Äôt mind most of the changes. I liked certain new additions like Yennefer‚Äôs back story and the Battle of Sodden. Others I didn‚Äôt such as the bits with Ciri &amp; the Dryads or the Doppler parts. In regards with Fringilla I don‚Äôt think they ever implied she was solely responsible for Nilfgaard‚Äôs rise, she was just a big part of it. Of course that‚Äôs just in the show though not the books. Basically everyone‚Äôs going to have different views, no one should make you feel bad just because they don‚Äôt agree with you.
The writers had to get ciri, geralt, and yen together asap. There is not enough time for back story development.  The writers did a fantastic job rushing the story to get it where it is now. You are going to have to let the lore go and allow the writers flexibility in order to get the show where it needs to be.
Nothing is perfect.
Question for Witcher Game fans :   I tried to play witcher 3 so many times i couldn&#39;t , i just play about an hour , and that&#39;s it i stop there , i come back another time start frm the beginning etc ...but i quit again , i don&#39;t seem to enjoy it the same as Skyrim i don&#39;t know why ...I cant pinpoint what i hate about it or likr about it because i don&#39;t know  and i can&#39;t seem to enjoy it for unknown reason
I&#39;m seeing that guy a Sumerman with long white hair nothing more maybe i should watch the series
Never read the books or played the game, but watched season 1 and looooved it. <br>Will read the books afterwards.
Yeah, I highly disliked how they portrayed Nilfgaard. The game of thrones was successful due to how gray the spectrum was in ‚Äúevilness‚Äù. In the Witcher they went full black for nilfgaard. Don‚Äôt get me started on that armor.... sigh. I wish the season had more episodes though to develop characters more and explain the lore
I&#39;ve never read the books, but I&#39;ve played all the games thoroughly. Just looking at it from a film perspective, the stories told in this show are just all over the place -- there is not enough cohesion and explanation as to what&#39;s going on. I think they did some re-shooting and tried to explain everything later on, but why not just follow a simple timeline instead of going back and forth with Cintra? The scenes with Henry Caville fighting monsters and bandits were great however, and I found myself sighing every time it switched to another character. I know that they wanted to give the women in this story an equal spotlight to Geralt, but there was just not enough time to invest in each character to truly flesh them out I feel (since we&#39;re having to constantly switch from one story arc to another). It was a decent show, but I think it could use a little more thought on behalf of the writers and hopefully things will improve in the future.
üôÑ
For all the IP&#39;s destroyed by hollywood I thought they did a great job. Books, games, and shows will never be identical.
It‚Äôs not the books or the game the things changed aren‚Äôt incorrect they are different because the show is it‚Äôs own take on the Witcher universe people just need to just watch and enjoy honesty it‚Äôs not that deep
I totaly understand your reaction, i had the same thing with the harry potter films, i hated the films because i read the books.The films were a shadow, of the harry potter world i had in my head. It did not live up to my expectations.
couldn&#39;t watch full episode 1, just looked too cheap with that CGI monster, too much like indian soap opera with the Bar scene. Also the fight scene was full of slow motion and that was almost like it wanted to be art or something. Performance wasn&#39;t any good , but what can you do with the script that cringe. Then we move to few scenes where annoying characters tells about how PC the series will be (not literally say it of course). For people who like it, it&#39;s ok we just have different opinions. For me this was garbage of the highest order, with a little slap to game franchise fans. And of course because we can&#39;t have nice things in life, even for those who liked it don&#39;t forget it will only go down from here ;) I immediately turned on Castlevania and it was freaking awesome. I wish this sh*t didn&#39;t exist, but if my wish would come true then tons of people who did enjoy it would miss out on all that fun. Never going to read the Novels because it became personal after the writer showed how greedy he can be and sued game creators. I often read books/novels to gain something from the writer, because he puts tons of his own mindset there. I don&#39;t even want to touch what that guy has. Also for me Witcher 3 has raised the bar for games. Just a real masterpiece. For the Tv series... I think you already know how i feel about it
It‚Äôs cool bro I personally loved the show game and your channel..maybe they drop that battle in s2 u know they do mad flashbacks
I hated this video, though I&#39;m glad you gave your opinion. It does seem like you&#39;re unable to accept that within an adaption it has to be digested by an audience that&#39;s not familiar with the game nor the books. When that happens you do have to expand on characters, plots, and settings.  Otherwise, no one will continue to watch a show that doesn&#39;t give clear background to the other folks in the show. A lot of your dislike basically boils down to you saying <i>&quot;It wasn&#39;t in the books&#39;</i> and that&#39;s not fair to the series. The books were written decades ago, so yeah, you gotta update when possible in order to speak to the modern audience. Lastly, saying that we didn&#39;t need to learn more about certain characters backstories is just wrong-headed. You don&#39;t seem to have any actual criticisms of the show besides,....&quot;It wasn&#39;t in the books...&quot;<br><br>Oh well stay well and have a good holiday!
I do hope they&#39;re able to build a believable relationship between Geralt &amp; Ciri
Please don&#39;t ever feel the need to apologise for sharing your opinion; it&#39;s up to those who can&#39;t accept an opinion different to their own to realise they are the ones that should be apologising.  I have my own opinion of the show too, just like everyone else will.  Now, my opinion is different from yours, and that&#39;s not a bad thing.  We are all entitled to our own opinions and I would be way out of line if I was to &#39;attack&#39; anyone over their opinion being different from mine.<br>Now, I haven&#39;t read the books but have a general overview of what happens and I can totally see why anyone who has read the books will have opinions similar to yours.<br>Like so many fans, I have played the games and my love for the world of The Witcher stems from there and I thoroughly enjoyed the TV show.  Saying that, I will say again that I can see why anyone who has read the books will have &#39;problems&#39; with the show.<br>But books and tv have always been different.  Overall stories are usually the same, but the details change for their target audiences.  TV shows and films adapted from books always tend to change things and omit other things - and that&#39;s not a bad thing.<br>If we go back to the start of your video, you say &quot;I think my issues with the show come from my having read the books&quot; which is fine.  It&#39;s ok  to have your opinion and it&#39;s up to us, watching your video, to accept your opinion even though it will very likely be different to our own.  Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films have all come under criticisms for the things they changed from the books, but they were still very successful.<br>Hopefully, The Witcher can enjoy similar success on TV in years to come...
The problem I have with the Netflix show is<br> (1) that Coin around the witcher neck. That&#39;s not a  Medallion<br>(2) Ciri storyline. Also I thought her father wanted The Witcher to find her and bring her back so (her father) can impregnate her. I&#39;m more confused than every watching this show
As a Witcher fan I enjoyed the series as its own thing, but I agree with your points and I can see why it&#39;s hard for you to dissociate the series from the books and the game since you&#39;re so invested in the Witcher original lore. Great video nonetheless! The possibility to express different opinions are what makes internet democratic and you should never fear showing your thoughts about something!
Somebody named the show in a review video comments perfectly. &quot;Bitcher 3: The Wild C*nt&quot; xD
I‚Äôm gona turn this off 3rd of a way through. This is less of a review and more of a comparison. I‚Äôve not played the games so it doesn‚Äôt matter to people like me what the games were like
Not having read the books or played the games, I thought the show was awesome.
Not read the book, not played the game. I thought it was pretty good. My only gripe is that the timeline issue, i wasn&#39;t sure what was in the past or present. It&#39;s no game of thrones but it&#39;s very watchable. Good casting choices too.
Reading the books always presents an issue when watching tv shows or movies. I&#39;ve been there myself with a lot of the Stephen King stuff. The witcher so far has mostly been character development, so they were obviously planning further series from the beginning. I think they did a good job, but you would need to be able to accept it for what it is rather than looking at what is different or missing from the books. Books always have more detail.
I have read all the books and played all the games (some even multiple times), but I still managed to enjoy it. I look at the show as a different version (more of a slight variation) if already existing stories. Kind of like a different universe maybe. I do respect your criticism and opinion and agree with a lot of the points, but the whole show is in a similar position as the games. It builds a world of its own based on already existing material. And as you said it&#39;s up to the viewer if they see this as Canon or not. It will probably even lead to more people reading the books and playing the games allowing them to form their own opinions and views.
The chronology of all the stories are so messed up to follow in the first few episodes. Also the bard was damn annoying. I had to skip forward whenever he spoke
It just sound like you don&#39;t like the stuff just because its new or diffrerent
A lot of the stuff they changed was for simplicities sake. Like the girl in episode 1 easily establishes the view of the general public about witchers, guides geralt to stregobor and functions as the one person to tell him to leave the town (even though she was shown as friendly towards the witcher). The same goes for Triss being introduced in the striga story. They catch two birds with one stone. Stregobor also became a bigger role to limit the amount of characters needed. Introducing so many characters to an audience that is unfamiliar with the source material would simply confuse and turn people of. If you would actually go into detail like in the books this season would have been told in 30+ episodes. <br>As for Yennefers story: They wanted to introduce Yennefer to the audience as a complex character which is done in the books by tons and tons of dialogue between Yen and Geralt. A lot of people who only played  Witcher 3 didn&#39;t like Yennefer since her character is not explained very well. You don&#39;t have the time to show her complete character in the show as those conversations in the books happen in several short stories of which some weren&#39;t even told. All those stories can&#39;t be told because you would have to add more and more characters and locations and dialogue. By telling Yennefers time in Aretuza they use a place and characters which have to be introduced anyways so there is no screentime lost.<br>The whole plot around Brokilon was a mistake in my view since it lessens the impact of Geralt and Ciris reunion but it was done due to the limitations of the three timelines. There was no way to get Geralt to the forest without breaking them.<br>Not all the changes are random and unnecessary. There are others that I don&#39;t understand right now. Like the magic system or Nilfgaard as a evil religious cult but I am pretty sure there are solid reasons for those decisions. Maybe Cahir doesn&#39;t end up with Geralt later and is actually an amalgamation of rience/skellen/cahir since they can&#39;t introduce so many characters (and do them justice). The Expanse did the same with Camina Drummer.<br><br><br>I understand that you are disappointed that it&#39;s not exactly like in the books but it would be impossible to produce such a show since it would take forever to establish the world and would cost a fortune to make. This show is made for a wide audience, not just the fans. It is a miracle that they managed to create a show that apparently does well with book readers, gamers AND people who are clueless about the Witcher. Could this show be better? Could there have been a smarter way to tell story? Probably. But finding that way is the hard part. With this post I just wanted to remind you that the people working on the show are working within tight limitations like money, season-length and making it captivating for a new audience while pleasing book and game fans.
Some of these criticisms are fair, but in general I totally despise the &quot;its not enough like the books&quot; critique, which is what most of this review boils down to. Live action adaptions are never very faithful to the source material because 90% of the viewers have never read it. Nobody wants to be boxed in creatively just to cater to a small vocal minority of viewers.  Stop telling us all the differences you don&#39;t like and just review the show on its own merits! <br><br><br>God do I hate the book snobs with any of these adaptions.
Well the off their loves it
I feel the same about the series.
I understand how you feel bc I feel the exact same way when it comes to Star Wars
I feel like if anyone was going to be employed to create the series it should have been you, given your knowledge and passion for the universe
Without condoning or condemning, I understand why there&#39;s a difference from the source material
The show is never going to be exactly like the books .. it‚Äôs better tht way so you can‚Äôt guess Whts going to happen
It‚Äôs an adaptation, it‚Äôs not meant to be the same as the books, that would be quite boring as a book reader as we‚Äôd know exactly what‚Äôs going to happen all the time. If you like the book story read the books, this is something different. Also adapting a book to a show 1 to 1 would not work at all, they‚Äôre not the same type of media.
Thanks for the video, I share the same point of view, what I dislike in this video is the amount of justification you give,  if people don&#39;t like what you say, they should just close the video<br>and keep it up
I feel the same about the show as I do about the books and the games. It&#39;s a fantastic idea that could be an amazing show book or game ....but...it lacks the depth of going above and beyond ...books are a 7 ...game 8 and show 6.5 out of ten. Its watchable except it
I have some agreement, the parts you said could have been cut I agree. But you are being overly and hyperly critical. The show&#39;s story doesn&#39;t pull from the game at all, so comparing anything to them is false to start with. So what if they expanded Yennefer&#39;s story for the show. They have to endear these characters to the audience, it&#39;s a little hard to do that if she got little more screen time than a side character. My biggest complaint is definitely that Ciri is way too old.
I agree with everything that was said. I have read the first 4 books and I was expecting a pretty close adaptation from the books but I was disappointed with all the changes that was made.
I watched the whole series, had fairly high hopes that quickly turned into laughing and cringing. I only know the world through hundreds of hours of game play, and I love it. The game world is absolutely superior to the show in every way for me, and it will be easy enough to forget my exposure to the show. I did not read the books and was hoping the show would inspire me to do so by going into new and exciting stories and aspects of familiar characters. That absolutely did not happen, and if the show reflects the books and the characters well, according to book lovers, I will definitely not be reading them. The casting hysteria is just fuel for the worst elements among fans and not remotely responsible for the main problems with the show. Most of the nonwhite actors did much better with the crap writing imho than some of the hilariously bad over-actors, like Calanthe. I&#39;m glad you made this video, the critiques for the show should not only be coming from those focused on skin color and who have an agenda that isn&#39;t really about the show.
@WitcherGeorge I hear you. Although I tried to come into this series with an objective view, I couldn&#39;t help but be annoyed with some of the changes this show made. Aside from my objections to the casting choices there were little things that began to stack up to become unbearable. While there was a lot to enjoy I would rather read the books. everything this show did is setting us up for disappointment in the later seasons.
Please do more videos like this. I think it is good that you are doing videos comparing the show with the actual source material. There is a lot of echo chamber stuff floating around right now that seems like any criticism of the show is being shouted down, to this is say stick to your guns and don&#39;t let it bother you. I think there is a considerable portion of the fan base that feels the same way. <br>I found you because of this video and subbed because of it. Keep up the good work!
My god for real...  i think we all know the bad things about the show but still is a really great show, they made a decent job....  the only big mistake The Witcher show did... was the comparison with Games of Thrones which is a WAAAY different show...  im a GOT lover and i didn&#39;t like  ALOT of things in the first season...  i rarely saw bad critics about it.....   im glad most of the fans who read the books and played the game did love this show....  for real... it pisses me off because I KNOW the real reason why they all give a bad review... oh well....
The problem is its never gonna be as good as the books, except that and you can enjoy the show, I did as about as much as I did Lord Of The Rings and boy did PJ take some huge liberties on that classic but it was forgiven because it was a great trilogy. I have to agree Geralt missing from Brokilon really made the final seen seem underwhelming where in the book it was emotional. I didnt think the Yennefer backstory was necessary until I watched it and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the show but unfortunately left Geralts short stories quiet trimmed. I do think the time line twists was done way better in the show compared to the Last wish book, I found it way more confusing and messy in the book and kinda just wanted the stories to be completely separate. All in all it did some things better than the books and some things worse but the biggest was Geralt not going to Brokilon, that was like not having the scouring of the shire in LOTRs but at least I new that before seeing it, I had no idea they were gone cut it from the Witcher, must have been a budget thing, Geralt did fight a Kikimore if I can remember or was it a Giant centipede, does anyone know?? That would have been CGI heavy and budget heavy.
totally agree with you
Guess they said that tv show will not blindly follow the books. I&#39;m just glad Witcher universum got itself on tv maybe sometime a movie too.
I can understand why you dont like it , I didnt play or read  the witcher before  and when I went into series  well it was a great 1 liked it very much :D maybe after reading or playing the game I would be more unhuppy about some things .
If they just copy the books or games perfectly what&#39;s the whole point of making a show when you will know exactly what will happen? You make some good points but you started off by saying how you live and breath the Witcher so your neutral stance was already destroyed from the start.
So basically good show, bad adaptation.
I&#39;m really triggered by you apologising for not liking the show and triggering people!<br><br>Checkmate, mate. =D
The show was very disappointing. The writing sucked, and the it was barely coherent or even entertaining for that matter.
Had Jennifer gone to nilfgarden the entire war could have been avoided because of her competency.
this guy reads the manga
I didn&#39;t know anything about the Witcher, I just thought it looked dope. Saw the show and it was just...weird. Good not great
It‚Äôs a mess. It‚Äôs terrible. I had such high hopes and it‚Äôs just crap.<br><br>Generic. Characters with no character. <br> <br>The tone of the show is all over the place. It‚Äôs trying to be an adult fantasy show...but then is directed to feel like a Teen fantasy story like twilight. The school and dance sequences with Yennefer were cringeworthy. It felt like Harry Potter. And the set designs all feel empty...characterless...and really clearly 90% CGI<br><br>And it‚Äôs hard not to compare...with game of thrones it felt like a mature lived in world... because they filmed a lot of it On Location. <br><br>I‚Äôm just sorry it was Netflix who bought this property because they‚Äôre just so bad lately at making anything. I wish this had been made by Hulu, HBO or Amazon, at least it would have had some quality behind it
Hey man, great video! Normie here and I just watched the first two episodes and have a load of questions. What would it take for you to review each episodes and tell us how they differ from the books and or games in detail? I had a few questions that you have already answered (like the eel thing) and would LOVE for you go through each episode and tell us how it is in the books and/or games. <br><br><br>So what would be the best way to possibly get that video? Just wait? Or hop on a discord? or Pateron? Im down for any/all of those, you seem to love your witcher and it shows! Would like to pick your brain on soooo many questions Witcher-wise.<br><br><br>P.S. Just worry about making good videos that you love. If it earns you love or it earns you hate, who cares? You keep doing you and whatever people do or say is on them.
I think you only dont like the show is because its not the exact same as the book, and honestly i thank thats unfair  but alot of your points are good like the brocolon part that is fair but alot of this vid is lowkey bias.
If you dont like something, voice it.  Coming from someone who loved the show and its flaws your opinions just validate to me what I like about it. And that&#39;s what film and t.v. do when dealing subjective subjects. Dont feel you have to do damage control man. You voiced your thoughts live by them and let&#39;s see if season 2 goes better for you! <br>-new subscriber.
Excellent review. Thanks!!
It&#39;s kinda anticlimatic and it has weird pacing, but it&#39;s still enjoyable for a fantasy show. Not the best Witcher but certainly not the worst.
I&#39;m not a fan of the show the only thing I&#39;m really happy with is Henry Cavill&#39;s performance as Geralt.
It has potential. It&#39;s only season 1, gotta wait til it picks up. I thought season 1 of breaking bad was slow and boring as fuh. That show turned out pretty good
Honestly what I didn&#39;t like about this video is how much time, how frequently you were apologising for potentially having a different opinion. All you need to do is say &quot;Please remember this is just my personal opinion and here is why...&quot; and move on
Idk, I have not read the books, but tried watching the show, and I&#39;m not that impressed, Maybe it&#39;s a decent show, but not a great one for me.
I think a lot of new fans are in the same place with Witcher as you are with LOTR.
everything you say is right, but I think the plots were poorly explained, the &quot;major evil, minor evil&quot; is not understood and there are like three timelines in the 2 episode happening at the same time and if you don&#39;t know anything about the books you&#39;ll not understand what is happening. My brother played the video games and he didn&#39;t understood anything. It seemed like a disaster and it doesn&#39;t convince me much it&#39;s is like it has no style or rhythm ... even the worst seasons of GoT have better direction.
I like the show and i played the games. Now im going to start to read the books. And i respect your opinion and appreciate your honesty on the show<br><br>Ill keep supporting you buddy
How dare you have your own opinion!!1! jk everyone needs to relax. Cancel culture is lame. You have some good coverage on your opinions, and the background music is a nice touch.
It looks Utter Pish, am no watching it!
I have no issue with the review, but it‚Äôs patronizing to tell people ‚Äúit‚Äôs totally fine if you like it‚Äù, yeah, we know.
I think they could have been more creative with the casting. The story has an Eastern European setting but why let let that get in the way. They should have cast Samuel L Jackson as Geralt.  They should have put Oprah Winfrey in there somewhere. The movie industry is very smart about casting choices.
The Yennifer stuff didn&#39;t bother me, I thought they did a good job telling that story, but I agree with your review. The actress tried in some acts, but they&#39;ve pretty much brought the SJW horeshit in, to destroy yet another singular opportunity. First episode made me binge watch the season. The final episode was lackluster and left me wanting, which is what happens in most fantasy (dark or light) tv shows. The director obviously has no knowledge of medieval warfare, and lacked the budget for an actual &#39;war&#39;. If they were gonna cherry pick I could forgive them. They added &#39;crap&#39; not from the books and then began shitting in their own beds. Typical and uninspired. The Queen and her death were so well done, it made the rest of the episode look poorly done. The actor playing the dragon gave a stellar performance as his usual, hell even the dwarf characters were entertaining. They had me going up until that finale (or lack of a finale). I&#39;ll watch season 2, but I sure hope it has more Henry and far far far less Yen. I concur with the video poster that Yen and the battle could have just been a story told by a supporting character (perhaps the head sorceress). I also agree that the character development with Ciri &amp; Geralt could have been dealt with in a much more effective method of story telling. Why would she run to his arms? They never met before according to the show.<br>I would have preferred just to watch Henry run around slaying monsters, especially when their portrayal of dark magic started to lean into the stupid gore tricks (like cutting the skin from an arm, having a MALE mage eat it, then gutting that mage so a FEMALE mage could wave her hand around his guts just to locate someone they were tracking. Crystal ball coulda done that yeah?
I didn&#39;t like how they kept putting Gerald in places he wasn&#39;t physically there for in the books. If I hadn&#39;t of read the books; the story would be confusing AF with how they keep switching from timelines and back stories to fill in expedition. Now I&#39;m not butt hurt over all of the changes, but I hope going forward into season 2 will be a little more forward regarding chronology.
I don&#39;t think you need to apologise and expect backlash for this video as you brought up many good points which would definitely improve the show, not just on staying close to the source material but also improving the depth in each character you discussed.   I have just purchased the last wish after finishing the Netflix series and playing the 3rd Witcher game multiples times so looking forward to comparing them all!
any1 alseep struggle to not to fall a sleep while watching?
I mean if it was too much like the books people would complain that the show is leaning too much on the books and not enough it own thing so it goes both ways
Love it so far so far cueently im on episode 4 that i watvhed  hanry cavil nail role of geralt of r curenhly finishing book last wish and i will read later on sword of destiny im considering of buying rest of witchrr saga of andzej sapkovski books must have and looking firward to season 2 of the witcher
Saying they&#39;re &quot;doing a storyline wrong&quot; seems weird. They changed it on purpose, it wasn&#39;t a mistake. It is an adaptation, so obviously it doesn&#39;t have to be direct from the books. Some Ciri stuff did feel like filler. I liked just about all the Yen stuff, even though I didn&#39;t like her in the games. Most Netflix shows suck, this is one of the better ones and a pretty good start.
I don&#39;t know anything about Witcher (books,games) but anything with swords and witches i watch without  hesitate , however now i am  in episode 3 but i am forcing myself to continue watching i started to feel that i am watching an NBC or CBS show ....kinda boring but i will still giving it a chance and i hope that i am not gonna  get disappointed  later......
Look it‚Äôs a good show and I have no reservations about saying it...but respect your opinion
I just want to say thank you for this. I think your review is spot on. As someone who&#39;s become super attached to the books, and love the ciri, dandelion, geralt and yen, I felt the netflix show did a great injustice to the characters and the world. I&#39;ll be showing this review to anyone who asks my opinion, because this is almost exactly how I felt about the show. Subscribed.
The only thing I shall differ from your opinion is that you are not seeing, that it is meant for people like you (who are deep in the lore), people like me (who are in some depth) and many who would join the whole universe(This is the LARGEST Chunk). It is somewhere they need to make loads of money to keep this coming out season after season for to be commercial reasons I actually understand why they did somethings. A first-timer who might jump into  A Witcher universe might get scared and move away instantly.  <br><br><br>Is it in the spirit of The Witcher is all I asked in the end? - yes, it is. Thus, things you pointed are not &quot;devastating&quot; to say &quot;not a fan of the series&quot;.  You are allowed for sure to like or dislike, but do I rather have this come alive in a lifetime, or just remain in books/games forever? is the question I  leave to you.<br><br><br>Though I do not agree with  Luke Skywalker&#39;s example you are comparing a real-life adaptation with another real-life adaptation. The adaptation of Assassin&#39;s creed was slammed as it was not no-where close to the books, spirit or the games and that is more suited for this situation.  Do I want more of what I saw? Am I glad they picked this project? - and to those, I say Yes.
Frangila ruined.
Triss ruined.
I agree with you because you‚Äôve read the books, played the games, and I assume you‚Äôre channel revolves around  the world of the Witcher. However, me being an uneducated viewer, I can say that I do like the show. The characters all feel very real. I feel love, frustration, annoyance, and anger towards many of the characters. They don‚Äôt feel fake and the actors did a great job. I like the shows version of Yennefer, because I feel a lot of love for the character from seeing her struggle. I personally wish they had more monsters and monster fight scenes. I also want the magic system to be beefed up as well. I am exactly what you pointed out. An uneducated viewer. I would ask one thing of you if you‚Äôve read this far, please review more of the series. I like your take on it and I will watch more of your videos to learn more about the world.
Why are there balck people in polish folklore?
Thought the show was dope
Yeah, I kind of wish they had used the universe and not the characters. I thought the character arcs were too different. I really wasn&#39;t happy with that element.
Please do a cinema sins kind of video so that I can see how many of the same issues we spotted.
The thing i couldnt get used to was the cast of certain characters. Pretty idiotic why they did that to be honest.
yeah, you are almost too invested it seems. which is understandable. its like the star wars super fans that get Angry. too much investment in anything will ruin an expectation. It happened to me with the XMen.  the sword play is bad ass, the magic and cgi is used well. if you want LORE, Play the Games and read the lore. if you want to be entertained, watch the show.
So, Fringilla is Black Panther/Wakanda? Srs?
B-grade TV reproduction. Feels more like a medieval/fantasy soap.
For some one who is not  up on the games or the books, I am finding the show to be decent.  I am entertained but was def a little confused by the way the constantly went back and forth with the time lines.  A little more references into the different kingdoms would have been helpful as well.
I was worried the show would focus more on Geralt fighting his unique style and other more hollywood focused things like effects, instead of what i consider to be the best aspects like well written dialogue, characters and the unique Witcher world. I was very worried it would be more like the &quot;killing monsters&quot; trailer and less like the books. I haven&#39;t dared watched yet and i probably never will. It&#39;s just not the interpretation for me and alot of other people.
I think you should retitle your video. Like you said yourself you nitpicked every detail. You are unable to see the show as its separate thing.
I really liked the show. Played the games and read the books and some things in there just wouldn&#39;t translate to the tv screen very well plus it&#39;s hard to fit some of those short stories into the time that they have. I like that there were aspects that aren&#39;t in the books, for example the scene of Gerald being abandoned by his mother reminds him what it felt like and that he needs to take Ciri under his wing just like Vesemir did for him. It&#39;s a lot easier to express these subtleties in books than on a show. I understand the show isn&#39;t perfect but I feel the criticism of it is a bit harsh sometimes.
But dude . The writer of the books is literally behind the show . You are saying you dislike true Witcher because the dude who wrote the books is behind the show
The Witcher (books and games) has been part of my life for 6/7 years. I agree on everything problems you mentioned, but I still enjoyed it. It is not the best thing we could&#39;ve gotten but still I would recommend.
I think it&#39;s funny how some people complaining about the show expect it to be some perfect amalgamation of the books and games. GOT didn&#39;t follow the books to the letter, even when it was still good up to the 5th season, still one of the best shows with all the liberties it took from the books up to season 5. The Witcher is definitely one of my favorite shows, didn&#39;t disappoint in any meaningful way, can&#39;t wait for season 2.  I think it&#39;s absurd to expect this show, or any based on books to have the same depth in character development for example, that is possible in the books, when we&#39;re talking about a tv show that has to take liberties in favor of presentation unless they&#39;ve got unlimited budget and 3 hour long episodes.
The show seems more like the game like first and 2nd witcher were blown through. i see them using a teenage ciri MORE as she is trained and takes up witchering...before she has to go on the run again. like in witcher 3
Yo man...<br>Listen...<br>U r right...the show did not contained every detail of the book...but only the people that read the book complain s about it and consider it as a flaw...what I saw was a really really good fantasy show that did it right...<br>And thank you for having respect...<br>I liked that...<br>But as I said don&#39;t see the thing that are in the book and are not in the show as a flaw of the show...<br>In that case u most be hating the game...:)
So it&#39;s basically an adaptation of the books, not a page for page recreation? I wouldn&#39;t mind this since I&#39;ve seen other shows do this like with the boys which is absolutely nothing like the comics, but in this case I&#39;m skeptical since the person directing it is a raging twitter sjw.
Please do a HUGE nitpick video
I hope they will add ciri and geralt encounter in brokilon forest in second season - after all they didn&#39;t know each other in the books and ciri used made up name... The problem is that she was searching for him on her own in the series. Anyway, i really liked the series, even if some of it is not acurate - it is a good show and it was fun watching.
I just dont understand why they jumped back in forth in time I&#39;m guessing so they didn&#39;t have to actually  do a full episode on one part and make it a in depth story but they skipped around when they really didn&#39;t have to I still enjoyed it but the only reason it isnt great is because Netflix has it
My god
I read the book, played the game, watch the show. You&#39;re very critical. You watch the show expecting it to be the same as the book, but book to movie adaptation is always different.  You already have several lenses and expectations before you even watch the show. I know the lore and I never expected the show to follow the same story page by page. Dont do critical critique when you know you have several lenses in place already.
Definitely not perfect. They spent way too much time with Yennefer. They powered her up so fast! Like where did she go from A to Z so fast?! I really dont like Yennefer in this show. Plus they gave my baby Triss plant based powers?! And gave her pyromancy to fucking Yennefer! Fuck!
I jus feel like your knocking it for taking story‚Äôs that are told or spoken in the books and making them a visual adaption to help give Yen and Ciri more screen time and background. What‚Äôs so wrong with that when your making a tv adaption?  Just calling it ‚Äúchanges‚Äù is a half truth.
game of thrones set the bar too high for fantasy shows. i thought it was good, kinda brings you back to those xena/hercules era of tv
I completely agree with you with most of the stuff you said exspecialy the Ciri stroyline .I dont agree with that that everything should be the same as in the books,but it wasnt he best adaptation o fit i agree with that
Yes! Thank you, I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m not alone. all my friends disagree with me and I couldn&#39;t find anyone who didn&#39;t like the show. Oh and don&#39;t even get me started on king Foltest
So op wants the show to be identical to the books....
I&#39;m not in award of your opinion being your opinion my question is you said that story line with garlt and ceri in the woods was their bonding how do you know that the story ended with their meeting I don&#39;t know I feel just give it a chance
The serie sucks. Hands down
You make a valid points and, as a books reader, I was noticing these changes in the story line. Having said that I liked the show and will be watching it, it&#39;s like with Game of Thrones, I liked the show and then read all the books, hopefully people will like this show and then go and read all Witcher books.
Personally loved the show, it was awesome. Cant wait for season 2.
The show is good if you know nothing about the Witcher to start with but if you knee deep in the Witcher for years I cant see how you like it
Your opinion is your opinion but i feel if the books where given a new book and show yennefers back story then you would just complain about it and its just nit picking
I can live with the raceswap with triss, but wtf have they done to fringilla? it got so bad i had to fast forward certain scenes where she was in.
I agree that turning Nilfgard into the bad-guys is a cheap story-telling move to create tension and a good-vs-bad narrative. i guess for simplistic viewing it has to be done this way because there is no time in a TV show to give proper explanation to all the motives and create a nuanced perspective. That is a shame, and also how they turned Cahir into an evil character rubs me the wrong way totally. I still want the show to do well and it was quite entertaining alltogether.
I find the writing subpar. A lot of the casting is off. It just wasn‚Äôt very good. I will try season two and hope for improvement. I don‚Äôt care about comparison to the books because that always ends in disappointment. Judging the show on it‚Äôs own merit it just doesn‚Äôt quite make for a good series yet in my opinion. Maybe season two can improve my feelings about it.
Considering how the books are, I think some additions are fine, and changes are fine, as it did essentially cover the first 2 books, but not all of book 2, which i hear they may add in season 2 along with book 3.
Witcher from Netflix is a disaster.
I understand where you are coming from but what you wanted to see was a fan film, but when trying to produce to a company you have to make changes to appease them. Next time you watch the show try not to focus on the things you dislike and instead focus on the things you did like. But I do agree that some things they didn&#39;t need to show
I&#39;m enjoying this made me wanna play the game all over again. what I wanna ask people though is who they think would win in a deathmatch? The witcher or the Mandalorian? I love the Mandalorian more than geralt but if you ask me give a witcher a lightsabre and Mando&#39;s in trouble.
Actually not bad at all. Far better than I thought it would be. Looking forward to season 2.
Why watch a show and expect it to be exactly the same as the books and the games? What&#39;s the point of a rehash? Just read the books and play the games. Even the games are not exactly the same as the books. This review is utterly pointless as it just says the show is different - earth shattering insight.
Bye bye
Ima click out
I loved the show. I thought it was awesome. But your point of view is very interesting. Id like to see a breakdown of all the episodes. Your video just makes the show even more interesting to me.
I respect you&#39;re opinion and you make some valid points however i personally loved the show and as a big Witcher fan it satisfied me.
This reminds me of a quest in BaW in Witcher 3 called Gwent: To Everything - Turn, Turn, Tournament! Remember, how they wanted to change gwent? I also wonder will we see gwent being played in the show, that would be fun
Wind&#39;s howling...
Jesus christ<br>Half the time you were just talking about how you dont want to offend anyone about your opinion.<br>1min of that wouldve been enough already man
For everyone that thinks you are nitpicking... yeah.  That&#39;s basically your job.  You&#39;re a lore expert, we come to you and watch your videos for that kind of deep dive into the lore and your analysis (also your accent is soothing, but that&#39;s unrelated).  And as someone who hasn&#39;t gotten too much into the Witcher, but want&#39;s to get more into it, your review is basically &#39;not bad, but could be better.&#39;  And that&#39;s fine.  Good video, keep it up.
Geralt parts were great, Ciri fine, Yen and magic in general absolutely terrible, driads and elves just cringe inducing. So i guess it varies from episode to episode if Yen part is smaller = higher score. Overall not unwatchable but can&#39;t become so called mainstream remembered show imo. And monster fights/dragon were borderline on quality of Polish Witcher series from like 15 years ago. Maybe not quite bad but seriously couldn&#39;t stop thinking during them how is Geralt not just dead tossing around the floor all the time with monsters on him, come on people stop this sourounded by 20 zombies on your back but they do nothing, saw enough of that in one episode of season 8.
How do you see the Adaption as an alternate Universe?
If I remember correctly, I think Sapkowski played a large role in writing the show and guiding how everything was portrayed. So maybe all that was shown that never happened in the books is what Sapkowski wanted it to be. I could be wrong though just a thought
I‚Äôve never played the games or read the books but I liked the series. I understand not liking it when you have an extensive knowledge of the overall source material. The movie Ender‚Äôs Game did that for me. I hated that movie because of the changes they made with it. I think with these show/movie producers they have the hard task of finding the perfect mix of source material and new material. Also they have to walk the line of not being too similar to the source material and to add enough new things to make the story fresh. IMO, that is the hardest thing to do with these adaptations. Hopefully season 2 will be better and they can bring something to the screen that everyone will like.
Thanks for being so respectful :) Coming from the Star Wars community, it means a LOT that you respect people who like the show even though you didn‚Äôt like it.
I find what they&#39;ve done very similar to Game of Thrones and A Song of Ice and Fire. There is simply too much to adapt and still maintain a reasonable pace and a group of characters you can remember without getting lost. ASOIAF has over 1,200 named characters. Different mediums need a different approach in order to develop characters. Personally I thought the tone and feel were excellent. It took me into a familiar world well. My only character gripe was Triss.
I hate that I agree with you as much as I do...
I enjoyed the show, but didn&#39;t think it was perfect mostly due to issues that you brought up here.  They certainly didn&#39;t bother me as much as they did you though.  I imagine they had their reasons for why they did certain things, such as wanting to introduce major characters in a notable way in the first season, among other things, so it is what it is.
I think that it might be a case that the writer of the book looked at the series and had a chance to change what he wished he‚Äôd done differently in the book, I of course see it the same way that if you look at it‚Äôs key elements it‚Äôs enjoyable but I do feel that it bastardised some of its characters and removed some of the intriguing aspects of their story and personality. Over all it did a disservice to its dedicated fan base to appease a larger audience and also to set it apart from the games as not to attract them to it as the writer of the books shown clear resentment and dissatisfaction with the games. Thanks WitcherGeorge glad to know that I‚Äôm not the only one left feeling disheartened.
One other piece of advice, never compared tv shows/movies to the orginal books. You will ALWAYS be disappointed.
Yneffer&#39;s story being made up did bother me
In 4k allot of this didn&#39;t seem horrible cgi. I liked it. It is a Netflix series it not as horrible as I had expected so that&#39;s why it dont bother me I suppose. I am surprised that super man did geralt did so well.
Bro chill out. Just state your opinion. You&#39;ll get people who hate you regardless.
When I was watching this, I kept hoping that they would change more from the books because the books are slow. Yennefer and Geralt&#39;s relationship are not well developed; Ciri&#39;s father has bad intentions for Ciri that should not be shown on screen. And Yennefer, Ciri, and Geralt almost never spend time together as a group of three. I wanted changes, changes to make the story better. I consider Yennefer&#39;s backstory to be a much needed improvement. I read the books for Yennefer and Ciri, not Geralt.
It&#39;s been a little while since I&#39;ve read the books so not all the details are fresh in my mind - but the things you brought up were things that basically didn&#39;t click for me with regards to the show&#39;s storyline, like I knew they weren&#39;t right, but I couldn&#39;t remember what exactly the right information was. I will say I have enjoyed the show, but can&#39;t help but notice but feel weird about certain story choices. And I 100% agree that Geralt&#39;s and Ciri&#39;s &quot;reunion&quot; was kind of void of earned emotion. I mean, as someone who loves these characters, it&#39;s still a nice scene. I just don&#39;t think the show&#39;s build up really earned that moment yet.<br><br><br>&quot;Something More&quot; is probably my favorite of the Witcher short stories. It was actually the last Witcher story I read (although, I haven&#39;t read the &quot;Season of Storms&quot; book yet). And I remember it genuinely making me feel emotional. And oddly enough I think it was because it was the last story I read. At that point, I know what Ciri and Geralt go through (both in the books and games), so to read the story where they first reunite was kind of touching. Now, I&#39;ve never really been quite able to explain this idea I&#39;ve had about &quot;Something More&quot;, but I&#39;ll give it a try. I remember thinking to myself that &quot;Something More&quot; would have been a beautiful story to tell split up either across the final season of a Witcher series, or in the Series finale episode. Basically, as we see Geralt and Ciri&#39;s story come to an end in &quot;present day&quot;, we also get to see flashbacks of the moment it started as a nice contrast. Hope that makes sense.
Great review, but wrong, show is amazing, loved every hour of it...<br>I&#39;ve noticed how reviews on YouTube have gotten so pedantic over the past year or so<br>How enjoyable the show or game is doesn&#39;t come into it anymore....
I have read the books and played the games. I really enjoy it. I see the show as its own thing. Many shows change things from the source material. I do feel like the show has a ‚Äúwitcher ‚Äú feeling to it. Some changes that are made are cringy like the Nilfgaard  armor and Yennefer fighting with swords(mega cringe!). The actors all do a great job in my opinion.  My only real issue with the show is that its really hard to follow for people who are not familiar with the source material. I am looking forward to season 2 of the show.
Wow very well said. Don‚Äôt think you are being picky. The show could use improvements for sure. I enjoyed it but editing and directing could be better.
you must change the name this is not a review it&#39;s a comparisation to the books so thanks for that anyway really enjoyed it
You say they made unnecessary changes. So your only problem with the show is everything that they changed from the books. I don&#39;t really understand this logic because a lot has to be changed for the Witcher to work in this format.  Yennefer had to have more backstory because that led up to her power act in the Battle of Brenna. Why did Yen have it and not anyone else? Because that was a way for them to show her power and development as a character. Season 1 was about giving these characters a backstory, development and a sort of platform to continue onwards. The show wants to show the dynamic between this trio instantly as seen when Geralt finally finds Ciri and the first thing she says is &quot;Who&#39;s Yennefer?&quot;. The show won&#39;t be the same as the books, so I guess thats what makes it bad?
Seems like you went to deep n picked it apart, its a good show with changes that obviously had to be made to make the show roll along a little smoother than a book. just like any adaptation n as for the first season of a new series overall any fan couldn‚Äôt ask for a better representation...
I do think that you&#39;re maybe approaching this at somewhat of a purist mentality. I too have read the books and played the trilogy. I will agree that they have changed quite a lot and some of it I wasn&#39;t a massive fan of but I understand that this an adaptation and can&#39;t be looked at as something that supposed to be 100% loyal to the books.
The show tries way too hard to make the audience care about the characters yet I found that I didn&#39;t care about any of them. I never felt invested in them, whether they lived or died. And then by the time of the battle I was completely uninterested and didn&#39;t care who won or why.
I don&#39;t understand why the writers of the series have to follow the exact direction of the books. If they don&#39;t have complete creative freedom, the end result would be terrible.
The rise of black people
The only issue I have with the series is the nilfgaard armor. Everything else is amazing
Having  read the books I know the potential this saga has as a TV adaptation and I agree with mostly everything you said, but I try to see the show as a separate entity with a soul of itself and not to judge it based on the new elements they took the liberty to add (I wish they also modify the final of the Saga and give Ciri something to do with such power along with some other thing) but what I cannot forgive them, like what were they thinking???is the fact that they cut off the meeting of Ciri and Gerald in Brokilon, the first time they bonded, how she didn&#39;t want him to leave her, this is so important for the fans to understand their suffering and to feel the emotion when they finally meet having going through so much in the season finale. I also agree they should have had a child actress for Ciri in at least the first two seasons. Ciri is a brave little girl going through hell in a search of her destiny father and this is what made me fall for her, cry for her and wanting Gerald so desperately to finally find her.
I have great respect for the content you put out on this channel and I get a lot of enjoyment from watching your Witcher videos. I do have very different opinions on the show than you. I am a fan who has the played the games and read some of the books. I didn‚Äôt have much of a problem with most of the changes in each short story. I loved the additional backstory on Yennefer. She‚Äôs my favorite character and I‚Äôve always wanted more backstory on her. A couple points I agree with you on though, the battle at Sodden where the Nilfgard mages sacrificed themselves (god, that was stupid), the fight between Cahir and Vieglefortz (just silly). And I didn‚Äôt mind the stuff with Geralts mother because I‚Äôve always been curious about his parents. While the writers did change many, many things from the books, I feel as though the adaptation has its own merits. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot.
Oh no, the show is objectevly bad, no matter how I think about it there&#39;s Just too much ridicuilos, weird or simply bad things. Still liked it though.
Sometimes you have to change the story from the books as it doesnt work on screen
I&#39;ve enjoyed it so far. One thing I am concerned about is people new to the series will be confused as hell. The show does not do a good job explaining the passage of time, or say which stories happen before others.
You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion. That being said, calling a tv show or a movie bad just because it‚Äôs different from the book is dumb. By that standard, all the marvel movies are trash, Jurassic Park is trash, etc. You‚Äôre definitely biased.
I found it really cringy and trope heavy...every single female character on screen seems to be of the ‚Äústrong female character woman‚Äù archetype...some of the acting is almost laughably bad and the writing and dialogue is shit poor...finally, CGI can be awful..on the other hand I actually loved Yennifers story and thought Cavill was as actually really good as Garald and some of the fight scenes especially with the swords were outstanding
I love the show overall, my biggest issues were:<br>1. Casting, I think minor characters such as the elf in the woods, Triss etc. weren&#39;t great choices. <br>2. The timeline skipping, going back and forth. I haven&#39;t read the books but love the games. I think that they could have been more clear when they skipped the first times. I had to spend 10 minutes googling in order to understand what the hell was going on, and I was by episode 4 at that time. In Westworld it was done brilliantly, and it was a big twist by the end.
Good review, and this is the pitfall of a lot of adaptations, stuff gets changed, left out, or unnecessarily added. Having said that I like it, even with all the changes it&#39;s still pretty good. It could&#39;ve been a lot worse, so much worse. Also don&#39;t ever apologize for what you know or your opinion.
I listened to your review and understand your opinions, but I summarise the only reason you don‚Äôt enjoy the show is because you can‚Äôt allow yourself to enjoy it. Of course it‚Äôs different it‚Äôs based on the books, it‚Äôs created for new fans and old fans alike but you have to be able to let go of your expectations and appreciate the show on its own merits. This is why you will be called out for knit picking. Also the actress‚Äôs age playing ciri is irrelevant actors always play characters younger than themselves. I do believe your best point is the missed opportunity of Geralt and Ciri together in brokilon, it was a moment of their bonding.
I haven&#39;t read the books or played the games and I still hate this show so far. I&#39;ve watched 5 episodes and just think it has terrible dialogue with characters doing and saying stuff that doesn&#39;t make sense. I like the fighting and stuff like that but I can&#39;t find much else I like about it.
I&#39;ve never played the games or read the books and I thoroughly enjoyed the first season and hope they continue the series. It actually made me want to play through all the games.
I think you should make the nit picky version of the show I would enjoy that shit.
Those who likes fantasy and medieval and has no prior knowledge to the Witcher world would absolutely love the series.
I think people should judge the show on it‚Äôs own merit. A lot of the criticisms here are just ‚Äúit‚Äôs not in the books‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs different in the books.‚Äù I have problems with the show but just complaining about the show being different than the books is pointless.
Blah blah blah... in the books! Blah blah blah... in the show! Meanwhile let&#39;s just watch clips from The Witcher 3 video game and nit pick on... Oh shut up, already!
Can&#39;t argue with anything you&#39;ve said. I&#39;ve read the books and played the game, more than once, BUT I liked the show and look forward to the next season.
Well it wasn‚Äôt Fringilla who saved Nilfgaard. The White Flame overthrew the previous leader and started turning Nilfgaard around. Throughout the show they talk about a Usurper who turned Nilfgaard into a  backwater place. You hear Fringilla mention to Cahir that he helped overthrow the Usurper. I do find it crazy however that a competent and old sorceress like Fringilla could be so quickly converted to worshipping a Nilfgaardian leader who has only been in control for like 12 years.
I can totally understand your opinion. I&#39;m in the middle of reading the books at the moment and I noticed the changes made in the show but it wasn&#39;t that bad for me as I don&#39;t have that long a history with them. I personally liked the show but I thought it had some weak moments/characters and a bit of a lack of Wittcher stuff. Now that&#39;s mostly stuff I liked in the games that isn&#39;t really prevelant in the books like signs, bombs etc. but still. But I can see why your opinion is so strong when comparing it to my own on the Harry Potter movies. A lot of people love those and they are good movies by themselves I guess but I personally can&#39;t really enjoy them because of the many unnecessary dumb changes made.
The only major disappointment with season 1 for me was the Battle of Sodden Hill. You could tell they were really stretching the budget and placing limits on what magic they could show because of it. They also made so many characters disappointingly inept; Vilgefortz, Triss, Sabrina, Coral, and even Yennefer was benched for most of it. Fringilla appeared to be the only one with a brain in that fight while the northern mages were running around and faffing about. Sodden Hill is supposed to be a heroic yet devastating victory, not a one-sided slaughter. It was such a letdown and a lousy way to end the season.
It felt soulless. Forced diversity, feminist talking points, and watered down story.  Oh, and the dick/balls armor is horrible.
I knew it&#39;s gonne be great review the moment I looked at the dislikes. Love how you don&#39;t want people to hate the show and just say, as many of us - book fans - feel, that there was a lot of changes that don&#39;t sit well with us. Keep up the good work, man!
It&#39;s inspired by the books... definitely not the stories from the books. <br>I&#39;ve only see the first 4 episodes (been insanely busy). I didn&#39;t mind the addition to backstory or changing stories a bit...it&#39;s the world changes that bug me more. <br>The whole magic thing bugs me. Killing off people for others to have more power isn&#39;t something from the books. Mages in general aren&#39;t &quot;good&quot; but having them murder (or change people to eels) to use their magic bothers me. Lords sent their daughters to Aretuza to be educated... those with powers had more education in magical arts... others went back to their lives and got work. I was also confused how Istredd was there... why were the Ban Ard &amp; Aretuza students together? Do they have the schools next to each other in the series? <br><br>So yeah, changes in the first 4 episodes, it&#39;s the magic and stuff with the magic schools that bothers me. I don&#39;t hate the series, I like parts of it, I just hate the magic parts. <br><br>Someone who doesn&#39;t know much about the series loved the series. Oh, and them adding in character and stuff I think is because the characters think a lot in books... having them stand there monologuing in their heads for an hour won&#39;t work, so they give them someone to talk to.<br>Have a great Christmas.
I would like an in depth video and n the changes between the show and the source material. I have played all of the games to completion and read the first 2 books in years past. Not enjoying the show so far.
tldr: not the same as the books = disappointing. this isnt a review, this is a comparison.
I only played Witcher 3 and this show is shit . It does not give me the same vibe, the estern european legends vibe.
&quot;Incorrect&quot; Uhh so this is an interpretation, meaning not an exact portrayal of the books...
movie makers just fucked the story. not even sure why they did it
thank you for your time and effort into this series....thank you for what you said as the show is great but disturbing at the same time. Good for you making this video.
I was really bothered by the use of bad colored contact lenses.
As a massive fan of the book sand The Witcher 3, I respectfully disagree with your points.<br><br><br>Spoilers ahead.<br><br>The only episode that really stayed true to the books was the first episode, the one portraying The Lesser Evil story. And it bored me to tears to see something I was already  very familiar with. It made me worry for the rest of the season - was it just going to be a rote play-by-play of the books? But I already know what happens in the books...<br><br>In making changes, they kept the show fresh for me. If I wanted the stories of The Last Wish and The Sword of Destiny, I would go and read those books again. In introducing new characters and sub plots, as well as showing scenes not portrayed in the books, it shines the events in a new light for me. I especially liked the scene where a character who is supposed to survive into the games got killed off. I love the fact that, if you went to a random viewer and said &quot;point to the villains&quot;, they would have no idea that two relatively incongruous characters end up being the overarching bad guys. The foreshadowing was so subtle that only book fans would have noticed it. They are making this their own thing, and that is not necessarily a sin in my opinion.<br><br>I&#39;m not defending all the changes - Cahir&#39;s characterisation was just moronic demonization of one of the most interesting book characters. He should never have come close to beating Vilgefortz. That&#39;s like a random stormtrooper beating Palpatine in a straight fight. Magic should have been left vague and undefined and the entire Brokilon subplot should have been removed if they weren&#39;t going to do it properly. The Bounds of Reason plotline with the dragon hunt totally missed the point. If they couldn&#39;t do it justice, maybe they should have adapted Nievellen&#39;s story instead. The scene where Pavetta and Duny start floating and spinning was just dumb, but not as ridiculous as Geralt being able to stop it by casting a sign. It blighted what was otherwise my favourite episode. There are probably a few more that don&#39;t come to mind right now.<br><br><br>I think that a fair amount of your dislikes may be coming from the idea that nobody who read and understands the books will appreciate the adaptation. It sounds a bit like saying &quot;you aren&#39;t a REAL fan&quot;, even though that&#39;s probably not what you meant. I still respect you opinion though!
never read the books...loved the series. But shows, games and books are all made differently.  just because the series is not a clone copy of the books, doesn&#39;t make the show bad. the show is great and thats that while not accurate but still great.
Straying from the books did annoy me at first but I just decided to enjoy it for what it was.
My hope is that they make some more seasons, and that the jump in quality between seasons is as dramatic as the jump in quality between the games. <br>The IP has huge potential for high budget television and I hope Netflix is able to make the most of this in the future.
It is Witcher Americana and never expected anything else.  Seen thru that lens it could have been much worse.  With what is on the market and produced today I did enjoy it but not anything to add to my private collection.  Passable Netflix fodder and that is saying something because most is not.
For me there is only 1 reason why I aint a huge witcher tv series fan. The nilfguardian ball bag armor
Res üëç
I have not read any of the books (I‚Äôve never cared for fantasy lit).<br>I tried the first two games and didn‚Äôt like them. <br>I have 100 hours in the Witcher 3 and really like it overall. <br>I think this show is passable for casual fans like myself, but seems like it strays too much from the books for hardcore fans, and is too confusing for total newcomers. <br>Overall, as a casual fan, I like the show, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good. I think that with some adjustments, a second season could actually be really great though. I hope they keep it going and make improvements/adjustments.
After the end of the Netflix series I researched the original Polish TV series final episode to remind myself how I was SUPPOSED to feel at that scene :(
So many only played the Witcher 3 and yet think they know all the lore lmao.
me and my friend yesterday watched all of it and we both read the books.<br>I think that it is just fine and i see the potential in it. I really didn&#39;t like how they changed important plot points , like Geralt not meeting ciri for the first time in the brokilon forest , triss merigold being there in the striga story, yenefer getting a background story, geralt meeting dandelion in the story about the devil and so on and so on.<br>I&#39;m just sad that the people who haven&#39;t read the books are gonna experiance the weaker versions of the stories told in the books.
You just keep saying, &#39;it wasnt in the books.&#39; Its a tv adaptation. Film and tv always make changes when they adapt books - they are totally different mediums. Judge it as a tv show on its own merits. The makers had their own reasons for making changes dont you think? Ps. I do love your witcher vids and have watched a ton of them - also a subscriber.
I thought it was pretty good, but as you pointed out, there were some pieces that were different or wrong according to the books. Made it a bit difficult to watch.
I loved your analysis. Very honest and insightful! I could see how much you were struggling to ‚Äúrain on anyone‚Äôs parade‚Äù but you did a spectacular job of telling how you feel and putting others feelings in mind too. I read the Witcher BOE and TOC and all the video games and I really like the show but I can totally see where you see the show falter. Love all your work and will never kick you for having a different opinion
Although I did enjoy the show, I really wish they would have kept the first meeting of Geralt and Ciri from the books. They had gotten to know each other a little before that big climax at the end when they reunited, and in the books it was so much more emotional and made more sense why she ran to him. I also hate that they left out Nivellan and the Bruxa fight... one of my favorite stories. They coulda cut out the Yen backstory or reduced it to one episode, it really dragged on for me. I still am looking forward to the next season, maybe they‚Äôll still add some of the missing stories and make up for it by showing more Geralt/Ciri interaction.
Just my opinion.. The makers don&#39;t have to follow the books exactly.
&quot;Adaption&quot; is the word you need to look up
There was no real world building unfortunately, i bet most people who&#39;re not familiar will hear names and will not understand the structure of the land, kingdoms and of course the races and the dynamics between them. The world didn&#39;t feel perilous enough with monsters running around. Dissapointed by some of the cast like Yen and Triss, Yen looks too young and her acting wasn&#39;t that great, Triss looks like she had a drug fueled party, Henry was ok as Geralt though. The monsters wasn&#39;t doing it for me, not otherworldly enough. I expected Geralt to use more signs but it&#39;s like the writers only remember he can do signs a few times during the whole season. Dissapointed with the CGI though, most of the time it doesn&#39;t even feel like a magical land. It was ok enjoyable at times but not great as i hoped it would be. Hope they improve next season.
You are right about it. Its crap. I&#39;m disappointed.  They should have followed the books and games but no....its Netflix so they do what they want. Disgusting
Im just a witcher gamer, havent read the books yet, only because I just havent gotten around to buying them but I thought the show was great overall but the jumping back &amp; fourth in the timeline was jarring as hell especially when they dont explicitly tell you. For a large part of the show I was thinking Geralt meeting Yen &amp; Dandelion, breaking the curse of the striga, etc was all happening congruent with Ciri&#39;s journey &amp; then after a little bit of confusion I realized it was all backstory flip flopping. Besides that personally I dont have many complaints except Geralts wig looked obviously fake at times &amp; his eyes are just yellow contact lens with normal iris&#39;s instead of having the catlike eyes that a Witcher was supposed to have. I loved Yens actress, I thought she did great, but tbh I really disliked Trish in the show. Maybe its cause im used to CDPR&#39;s Trish but she didnt fit the role imo. Those are just my humble opinions tho, I hope you end up liking season 2 better. Much Love &amp; happy holidays bro!
Well for my exp, I never read or played the witcher before but now that watch the show (which was good with some flaws, imo), i just boght the witches 2 and 3 game. And bacome a new fan of the series, so Im thankful of the show for helping me get into this awesome universe.
I&#39;m concerned that they are going to combine Cahir and Rience into one character. That would be a bad move. One small change that really bugged me was Geralt trying to find the Jinn to cure his insomnia. So ridiculously out of character considering he knows the dangers of trying to control a Jinn. He spent the rest of the story attempting to stop Yen from trying to control the Jinn, so why the fuck would he go looking for one. It was a small change, but it was just stupid writing. I suspect they didn&#39;t have the budget for a 12&#39; CGI catfish, but Geralt and Jaskier could have still found the Jinn while fishing, and it wouldn&#39;t have been totally stupid.
I mean, most of the changes are made to make everyone have a closer relationship towards the character, especially for people that haven&#39;t read the books and will just totally not care about Yennava, and it&#39;s trying to drag more non-fans in.
Not knowing anything about the Witcher I went into this without thoughts of discrepancies or costume mistakes etc. <br>Given that I can say it was just so cringe worthy. Bad acting, bad lighting, bad dialogue, bad bad bad. Managed one and a half episodes before throwing it into the virtual rubbish dump
please, make a video where you list everything wrong with this series so people may understand why it is mediocre compared to the games and novels.
Why is no one talking about that Witcher killed by a striga didn&#39;t have yellow eyes on the show??? I mean yellow eyes is a major characteristic of all witchers yea? And what about the dwarves for goodness sake...they are played by actual little people but the dwarves from this universe are an entire different race strong stout beings similar to LotR, no offence to little people but hey the production is and looks cheap üòî
I&#39;ve finished watching the season. After my initial excitement wore off, I have to agree with you.
First minute of this video is talking to all the 2019 soyboys and girls who dont deserve opinions to begin with anyway /shrug
This show felt like a chick flick and just so barebones in everything that mattered
Very interesting to hear the opinion of someone who invested so much time into the actual lore of the books. Myself as someone who only played the games, enjoyed the majority of the series. This doesn&#39;t mean it was perfect and I understand your PoV on the series messing with the idea you formed about the characters prior to the series: My idea of Yennefer was heavily tainted by the series. She was one of the favourite female characters of all games I&#39;ve played and giving her such detailed origin story in the series took away all her mystery. It simplified (and in some way vilified) her drive and motivations and as her drive made her such a competent character to begin with, seeing it came from such manic motivations was really disappointing.
I&#39;m jus confused to y they thought adapting short stories would be a food Idea did we really need to know anyone&#39;s back storys? That made the show messy wit all these back n forth where r we.10 years past? Stuff lol
These people. Again with these people. You read the books and expect the show to be identical. That&#39;s not how it works
I likedü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I agree with your opinion on how the show deals with Magic. This is the witcher franchise, not fullmetal alchemist -_-
I never played or read the books but I really like the show.  It made me want know more of the Witcher&#39;s universe.  It&#39;s interesting to hear the opinions of someone who played and read the books.  My favorite characters so far are Yen and Tissaia.  Sorta reminds me of the relationships between Kenobi and Vader (before he became Vader).  Cannot wait for season 2.
The show was utter crap
Nice review and commentary. I never read the books. I attempted to play the Witcher III, but, really, did not have that kind of time. I have so far watched the first 3 episodes, and I am not really liking the show. It just seems the story is very slap dashed, and maybe that is why for you you see all the disconnections in the characters. The PRoduction quality is great, but that does not overcome bad writing.
I think you just want the show to be a copy and paste of the book.
i played through the witcher 3 and just finished this season. I enjoyed it, but i think their are problems. Hopefully you enjoy season 2 more :)
No show or movie that is based on book will be exactly like the books. The one to one adaptation will never happen.
I agree and disagree with you but I respect your opinion. I&#39;ve played and fell in love with the witcher 3. I want to read the books but don&#39;t know where to start. I love the show and like their take on the characters. It is in a show format show changes are expected and should not be expected to be 100% exactly like the books. You used the lord of the rings as an example but you can say the same thing about harry potter and any other adaptation. It&#39;s a give and take thing. You weren&#39;t really into it because you have an extensive knowledge and emotional connection to the series. You are a passionate fan and that&#39;s awesome. Anyways keep up the good work I wish you nothing but the best and I&#39;m definitely subscribing and I&#39;m going to watch more of your  videos so I can learn more about the witcher universe.
George. You&#39;re more knowledgeable than most of us re the Witcher. <br><br>Don&#39;t pander to these people that come at you for nitpicking... I feel this video would&#39;ve been alot different if you weren&#39;t so worried about people&#39;s feelings. You&#39;re allowed to upload a personal critique my man, don&#39;t need to constantly defend your opinion.
This video: 90% apologising for shit no one cares about 10% review
Bro these fanboys in these comments r ridiculous he stating his opinion n ur taking it personal.this is the 1st guy who kept it <a href=""http://real.it/"">real.it</a> was up wit down wit sum mediocre performances.n same henry was alright.mainly do to his limited acting range
Your criticism for how they went away from the books is warranted, but you have to look at it from a different point of view--that its being adapted for tv and changes are necessary for the narrative to be acceptable to viewership
I read the books and played the games and I enjoyed the show. But I can see why you as invested into the lore as you are wouldn&#39;t like it. It&#39;s been a while since I read the books but there were alot of times I was like WTF.  Great video tho Witcher nothing wrong with having your own opinion. You reminded me of some stuff I had forgot about from the books, which is maybe to my benefit in enjoying the show.
Intro points out just the negative of someone having a bad opinion of something you like. I feel differently about that. I  go out of my way to see what people dislike about everything I like, its helps me see why I enjoyed it when others didn&#39;t ormaybe its something I didn&#39;t notice. The Witcher books, show and games have been great and I&#39;m happy they are different, if one isn&#39;t as good as the others, I don&#39;t see it as a negative, I see more of what I like getting a chance to show up in different medias.
I disagree with some of your review, but I liked your video and your opinion never apologize for thinking, acting, or saying things that others may dislike.
I haven&#39;t read the book so I can&#39;t talk about how good or bad this is as an adaptation. But a a series, is mediocre as best. It has some good moments, mainly Yen story (at least until she suddenly changes her whole purpose in life without any solid reason) and Geralt&#39;s contracts. Action sequences are great too. But the overarching plot is a mess. Ciri&#39;s story could have been reduced to three or four sequences. She is an important character for what she is, not for what she does (at least at this point) and in fact she does nothing but wander aimlessly until she does what she was told to do in the first chapter. There is a lot of plot contrivances (Yen is a powerful sorceress, she can freeze in place enemies but in the next sequence she has to fight another round of enemies with a blade just like Geralt. The Doppler absorbs all the memories of the person he embodies but then he can&#39;t answer Ciri&#39;s questions) and the ending is anything but satisfactory with Geralt doing absolutely nothing but babbling about his mom laying in bed. I watched the second trailer like a hundred times so The Witcher has been for me the biggest dissapointment on TV this year.
I get your point that the show will not help people who played the games and just want to know characters&#39; backstory, but the rest actually seems like nit picking. And not because i think that you are actively trying to find reasons to hate that show, i believe you are honestly dislike it and the reason you explained is totally understandable. You and i just have different states of mind. I think that your inability to abstract yourself from the books and games that prevents you to view the show as an alternative story is the root of your problems with it. Because no matter how good or bad the show is - the books and the games are still there, the show just cannot ruin anything because it cannot take the original story from you. I try to enjoy different interpretations of the stories i like. I even like the old polish tv series despite all of it&#39;s flaws that i won&#39;t deny or justify. Yes, it&#39;s cringey, it has awful cgi, it doesn&#39;t follow the books, the whole witcher-samurai thing etc. But it has it&#39;s moments. Great music, atmosphere, some scenes that were changed from the books or invented specifically for the show were great, like the fight between Dandelion and Yennefer and how they both accuse each other in having bad influence on Geralt. The same is with the netflix show. Yes, it also has it&#39;s flaws, alot of them in fact, but some things are great, and some i find even greater than the books. Tissaia de Vries for example, became my favourite side character. And in the books the only thing i remember about her is that she commits suicide, cuts her veins after the events on Thanned. Which, if it will make its way into the show in later seasons, will work amazing in her character arc, since one of the first things she does in the show is saving Yen who tried to do the same.
It had some lame looking cgi, some lame acting, some lame costume design but the biggest problem was pacing. It was¬† confusing¬†or just flat out boring for the most part.¬†8 hrs and I still don&#39;t think they&#39;ve actually explained what a witcher is. You&#39;re going to lose audiences who aren&#39;t fans, and probably those that are fans¬†with this boring and confusing slop.
Never played the game and the series was just amateur. Cavil is good but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching cbbc with violence and swearing
I personally don&#39;t mind the changes. It&#39;s an adaptation, not a recreation of the books. Just like the games, the show has its own vision and interpretation it follows. I can very well understand why some people don&#39;t like it, and that&#39;s great! Would be boring if everyone shared the same opinion. For me, it would also be boring if we would ONLY see book content with nothing new and creative added to it. If I want just the books, I will read the books. I, for one, really enjoyed it and can&#39;t wait for Season 2.
No, George, you are right all the way, as an avid book reader &amp; witcher player, I&#39;m also very disappointed about the show... Instead of beautiful Christmas TV show we got idk what... So now i can&#39;t even recommend it to anyone lol, I still say go for (audi)books instead they are waaaay better. There are some positive moments in the TV series even some interesting scenes that would be a great fit for books but overall it missed a lot. As u said instead of making up a lot of new (unimportant and bad written) stories they should rather expand existing ones and make the show more similar to books.
honest and an on point video great job
I thought the show was great besides one major issue Yens casting and how much she was in it seemed like she had more screen time then Geralt
Tbf the show looks good, but i just cant ignore some problems. The timeline is messed up, the jumping back and forth (if you have no idea who&#39;s who) is confusing. The magic, the law of it, is confusing. I thought you need a conduit for every cast? How come some die for making fireballs, and some can conjure whatever the fuck they want without anything in return? Why do the mages fight with sword too, it doesnt make sense. Yennefer too, she should be a special gifted sorceress, but what does she do? Being an ass? She was only useful on the last ep, that&#39;s all she did. The magic water too, why introduce a concept, and the rule &quot;everyone who comes here  must drink&quot;, and completely forget it? The doppler leaving Ciri randomly tied to a tree and disappearing forever doesnt make sense given how they portrayed him beinh obsessed with her hair. Aretuza is lame. Nilfgaardian armor is shit. Triss is lame. And i cant fathom how a single court mage can defeat ann entire group of high wizards. The fuck is Fringilla so OP? It doesnt make sense.
WitcherGeorge never apologise for your opinion. You say what you believe is true from your perspective ( that is one of the reasons love your channel, you speak honestly not to please anyone you are just honest and its great ) . As much as i loved the show, I can honestly also see what your saying and see where you are coming from. The fact it is meant to be taken from the books is very difficult to get onscreen as much as it is in the books. As far as actors portraying their characters correctly.... This is the first season, as with any show the actors are still learning their part learning their place later they will become more attuned to their place and feel more comfortable. I also agree with you about Ciri, I was disappointed as yes she is a lot older than she was in the books, but in saying that I think she played the part very well. There was a lot storywise which was incorrect compared to the books in fact i would say most of it was... As said in a post in one of the other vids you posted and I will say again. I do not mind so much if they change the storyline as per say as long as the long term goal is to NOT change the overall story result or more importantly Characters and how the books portrayed those characters. But yes some aspect of the changes or &quot;poetic licence&quot; they seem to be using is slightly disappointing. If there was one thing that really disappointed me and it was one thing you never even mentioned and it was continuity for example EP1 Geralt kills Renfri a slight but deep cut to side of neck.. later we see throat has been totally sliced.... all through the episodes there was some serious continuity issues which was &quot;where did that come from?&quot; or &quot;huh?? it wasnt like that before&quot; to me i found that more disappointing than deviation from actual book storyline.
Reading the books Does make it harder to enjoy the show,<br>But I still managed it in spite of myself.
I think you are right, that it depends on the approaching mindset, the expectation, if people can enjoy it or not. I studied the books more than my school books, wrote my own elder speech dictionary and timelines for characters, tried to make chronicles of the kindoms and territories to collect my knowledge. When I found the games, tried to expand it by trying to find all options and add new information that seem the most fitting and so on ... <br>From the beginning I just knew, that no production is even able to catch everything of this world. So I didn&#39;t expect them to create a fully appropriate depiction of the books in depth, becasue it is just clear to me, that this will never be possible :D <br>I was more curious, what they will make out of the material. And for this, I am now just happy about everything they actually did get right, everything that only reminds me of the world of the Witcher. <br>That doesn&#39;t make me a dedicated fan of the series, I see and agree to all the points of concern mentioned in the video. Still I do really enjoy watching it, discovering the little hidden gems (becasue in the end, if people use this budget and effort for a show, there must be at least a bit of enthusiasm present in one or another responsible person I am convinced) and looking forward to what else this world can &quot;incite back&quot; in the creative mind of people, other than me.
say what you want... its a good, well directed TV  show. While the story dont follow the books as much they did a good job... it didnt flop and ppl like it. Even though you said you did t like the tv series... I am sure you will watch the season 2
I liked the show but I understand well how you could dislike it within your context. I can respect this, as someone who has read GoT and then the show was so much more shallow.<br>I found Yen&#39;s background story not so bad, but I also haven&#39;t played the game too much or haven&#39;t read the books.
I realy wish that you make a whole videos about the mistakes in the show because they are ruining one the best fantasy world&#39;s lore. I honestly wish if I can forget everything I saw in the show, and not get my favorite fantasy worlds ruined.
I agree in general George. I haven&#39;t read the books or played the games but have watched some of your Lore videos (as well as others from other channels). I watched because I love fantasy genre. Unfortunately, I found the directing and writing sort of lacking? Still, I hope it gets a 2nd season as many shows in the past just find their footing in Season 1 and continue on to become really good. I only hope the story wasn&#39;t sacrificed due to the creator/showrunner having an agenda other than good storytelling, your analogy to Star wars was dead on I think
Greetings,i have read the books but it was a while ago and i really didn&#39;t get the story changes in the series but now do remember how beautiful geralt-ciri meeting story was in the books , thank you . Hopefully they&#39;ll do something in the future seasons.
It is different than books, so people knowing books will get surprise here and then too. Isn&#39;t that the same in the games ?
Never read the books and never played the games. I liked the show.
I felt that it succeeded for the most part at adapting a story fit for tv based on the books. While some of the changes do not develop characters as well as the books, I feel that the show still tells a good story separately from the books.
I personally love it just for being the best rendition of the Witcher to come to the big screen. I agreed with all of what you say too. I thought Henry‚Äôs Geralt was the most accurate portrayal and his fight scenes were beautifully done!!  Much like game of thrones it‚Äôs not going to follow the books 100% but was entertaining
great video. you basically read my mind, this whole time I thought that I was the only one who didn&#39;t like the show because of it&#39;s style and the characters, but you said everything I was thinking about so thank you.
Imagine being a witcher content creator and not supporting the first live action adaptation. I geuss you do not want to feed off 7 season of there HARD work oh wait you still will. Dude you can have problems with it even dislike but to use your influence to dissuade people from watching it is honestly fucked up. Just consider how much growth you will get over the next 3 to 7 years and one day think back to how you spit on this adaptation.
Ah, you folks are the &quot;But IN THE BOOKS&quot; crowd. Not the most pleasant crowd...
I get where you are coming from as a purist to the subject material, but you come across like you expected the ty show to be exactly like the books and that just never happens. It drove me a little nuts with Avengers Thanos/End Game and the Infinity Gauntlet saga. As a Marvel purist and a Silver Surfer fan they went far far away from the epic comic story but I had to accept the situation and go in knowing the movies were not be close to the source material. But you learn to live on and go with what you get and analyze for what it is, not what it isn&#39;t. You just help me out with getting the real back story in order to help understand what we got, and the same with Game of Thrones I didn&#39;t read the books and so it didn&#39;t matter. You can be yourself that is no problem and for those who don&#39;t like your views then screw them. I think Superman found his true calling as the Witcher. Also I don&#39;t play the video games, any video games for that matter.
you are right the show has some issues but i hope they learn from their mistakes and make improvements in the second season
You&#39;re totally wrong about Nilfgaard. It was Emhyr, not Fringilla who made Nilfgaard strong
The show is bad and feels very fan serivicing. The actor choice/makeup/costumes for Yen and especially Tris are horrible, the witcher himslef is passable.<br>The camera play, scene setup and lensing is horrible in the show and even gives you eye cancer when it is moving too fast ...<br>The time jumping is bad, it is good in the books because it is another medium but for TV the director has made a poor adaptation for it and most people will dislike it and feel irritated or confused.<br>Many of the epsiodes feel like they come from Hercules or Xena with witcher dialog and monsters sprinkled in.<br>Even the nude/erotic scenes fall flat because the viewer is just bombarded with a cacophany of nudes without any spirit.<br>But the most prevailing thing that comes to my mind when watching the show is just &quot;CHEAP&quot; ...
I agree with your passion and your observations. However I think you&#39;re missing the wood for the trees, of course they have made changes for the shorter TV episode format (especially considering they have to introduce Ciri and Yen right from the beginning) and hard-core fans like us are not the target audience but rather new people.<br>What I feel is despite these changes, they have not screwed up the essence of the characters and the world, which is a win to me. Trust me I had very low hopes for this show after the &quot;blackening&quot; of Fringilla, Triss, Dryads and Elves, but I am enjoying watching this and feel happy to recommend it to my normie friends.<br>And needless to say I have played the games and read the books and I didn&#39;t like some changes the games did too e.g. Triss would never tie her hair, it&#39;s not just a fashion thing, but I love the games very very much especially TW2 and especially the game Triss, her looks and romance both
This is my opinion of what you are saying.  I stopped watching your video after you gave that disclaimer that you didn&#39;t like the Witcher series from Netflix.  I thought it was great.  Sure, there were some things they could have done better (e.g., casting of Triss Merigold, etc), but I really enjoyed watching the series.  What I am getting at is, if you give a thumbs down for the series, you are basically saying, cancel this series Netflix, I don&#39;t want to see another season.  I&#39;d prefer to see your great new original series like The Marriage Story and All the Freckles in the World.  Right ‚Ä¶  I have a Netflix subscription, but every month, I wonder why I should renew it.  90% of what is on Netflix is junk.  95% of Netflix&#39;s original content is junk.  Netflix is spending hundreds of millions of dollars creating horrible original content with a hit like Stranger Things here and there.  However, if Netflix created more shows like the Witcher and continued renewing the Witcher for more seasons (thank goodness season 2 is already renewed), I could see myself keeping Netflix for the long term.  However, if the reviewers say that it&#39;s a bad show and that it should be cancelled, I cannot agree with that.
The show is trash, i&#39;ll stick with the games/books.
I 100% agree with you. Also Nilfgaardian armour looks really bad. And CGI is ugly
I think things like adding little elf boy and showing geralt as a child is there to build up people sympathising with elves and to show that geralt was a vulnerable kid when he was put through witcher training
One thing I disliked about the show was how it was so hard to tell what was a flashback and what isn&#39;t
very nice review, i agree 100%, keep up the good work.
Gotta say though, as a non white person who dislikes the diversity casting, white people calling every non white character BLACK is jarring. Yen&#39;s actor is not black. Triss&#39; actor is not black.
I think this part of the story is the hardest to adapt since they only had shor stories with gerald jumping here and there and a bunch of confusing episodes at the end of book 2 that suddenly transforms everything into a large scale story. I think that despite the dificulties they have managed to do a decent job and i totally look forward to season 2 to see how they will adapt the main arc of ciri and geralt.
Unsubscribed
Can I review your review! A N A L
Henry is perfectly casted. Rest of the others (especially yenifer) sucks....
I&#39;m going into this thinking hes going to be objective not subjective but his name though so lol
They said that they would adapt the book. That statement was a load of bull the moment they did the casting. If anything, the show shouldn&#39;t be called &quot;The Witcher&quot;.<br><br>Creating a whole different story would have done it more justice and would have served their narrative.<br><br>Everything else aside, Henry Cavill&#39;s acting was spot on
Suggestion: please put out a video every season on Netflix&#39;s the Witcher changes from the books.
I have not read the books yet and i have only played Witcher 3 for now and with everything you said i have decided to treat books, games and the show as alternate realities of each other and i love each of these on their own. Besides, people will always have diffrent opinions, but the best thing we can do is to accept each others opinion and remeber that we can all love the same thing in diffrent ways. Merry Christmas Witcher George and a succsesfull new year.
Very good review containg many important arguments, but stop talking about opinions and stuff, it took you quite big part of video and added nothing.
Personally I think the show requires a 2nd viewing to get the most out of it. I mean doesn&#39;t have the typical pace of an American TV series, so it&#39;s easy to be thrown off imao.
is it just me or anyone else found it weird Yen says &quot;They took that choice(to be a mother) from me&quot; when they established <b>she chose</b> to have that taken from her?
I think never have read the books or played any of the games has a lot to do with me loving the show.  Big thumbs up for being honest in your opinion.
Lets all agree that Most of the witcher  fans learn the books from the <a href=""http://game.now/"">game.Now</a> we can  say that a new portion of fans learn the witcher from the Tv series. At the end more fans for the witcher thus more games and books for us !!!its a win win
Yes yes we get it, you dont like the show because of all the knowledge you gained it seems inaccurate. You dont have to explain that 10 times. I liked your video btw
I think the same .
After playing Witcher 3 and watching the last episode, all I could think was &quot;Fking nekkers&quot;.
There are alot of changes, but i don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be literally adapting the books. I think anyone who expect a literal adaptation of the book will be disappointed.<br>I believe they&#39;ll continue to change a lot, it&#39;s good i did not read the books.
I get where you‚Äôre coming from.  You‚Äôre comparing the show to the books.  I‚Äôve done the same with books I love, and the movies never satisfy by comparison.  Perhaps fortunately, I never read the books and only played a little bit of the game so going into it I was actually very afraid that it would be poorly written or poorly acted but I was very pleasantly surprised. The series scratches that itch We all have for something adventurous, romantic, fanciful, and possibly horrific. A lot of the bad rap that it‚Äôs received so far is coming from people who are comparing it to Game of Thrones. Just another example of how when you compare something to a production that came before, it prevents you from enjoying the moment and appreciating the new work of art on its own merit.
No need to apologise, the series is a garbage. Not only the plot, but the mediocre CGI, lousy prosthetics, jumping from scene to scene, jumbled timelines, ball of the mages that looked like high school prom, Halloween contacts...In one sentence, low budget and bad production vibe.<br>I felt so bad that I had the need to read the books once again. üòû
FINALLY someone had it right! I also made a review about it and i am not trying to be good there mate xD<br>Terrible show. I totally agreewith you, shame for the people who read the books. No respect.
I totally agree with you and I am so glad someone else also has that same opinion as me...they just made so much changes from the books...I am quite angry at themüò°I had hope when they said it is gonna be according to the books but frankly I ak dissapointed...I like game story and game characters better...they are more like in the books-or at least how I imagined them in the books... Shame..
I will disagree about presenting nilfgard as evil , in the series they also present cintra slaughtering the elves . And this military power wouldnt be aquired just with a mage nilfgard has thousands of soldiers
I watched the first half of the video, it&#39;s very interesting to hear you mentioning many of the changes the script writers made during the making of the show. As someone who knows a bit about show making, I personally think that it is quite hard to make a show as great as a masterpiece considering the funding and limited time budget. I do like that the team behind is putting Yen as a main character, the idea is great. However, like you said, there are quite few materials around Yen like around Geralt and Ciri.<br>To further strengthen my point, I want to give an example of the directors of &#39;At Eternity&#39;s Gate&#39;. In order to tell the story focusing on Van Gogh, Julian Schnabel and his team decides to think as Van Gogh and his friends, giving various plots that logically could take place considering Van Gogh&#39;s personality and other traits. I do not hate this way of creating a show, so the way they&#39;re giving us the idea who Yen is for me looks quite nicely done.<br>After all, that&#39;s my own opinion. I&#39;m a fan of this witcher world. Hopefully with more potential funding for season 2, the team will give us a better answer.
adaptation sometimes different from source material, many infuriated
The Nilfgaardian armor makes zero sense, it&#39;s in reality harder to make, poor peasants would most likely wear gambenson anyways, rich nobles like Cahir would wear something more expensive and better looking.
Huge witcher fan over here, I&#39;m with you man, really I&#39;ve been immersed in this world and characters for more than 4 years now, I&#39;ve read all the books, played the witcher 3 and even adapted the world into a D&amp;D campaign creating dozens of rules and homebrew content and your channel has definitely helped with that, the points you make are 100% right, the show doesn&#39;t do justice to the short stories in favor of a more main plot kind of thing but still with all that there were too many unnecessary changes but at the end of the day I still found myself capable of enjoying the show and connecting with the events emotionally, mostly because of how much these stories have impacted me emotionally. So thank you for this review and everything you do and I hope the showrunners watch it, criticism such as this will most definitely help them down the line!
I think they sacrificed more specific detail with characters for the sake of world-building and introducing a new audience to the series.
Exactly! They changed so much I was a bit annoyed by it as a fan of the books &amp; games.<br>Still a lot to like in the show though, not all of it was bad and overall the acting was pretty good.<br>I think there&#39;s a lot of potential still for season 2 if they manage to fix some of the issues the first season had.
Man, I am with you... With the show coming out I reread all the books and I just feel like the writers took the base points. And I mean base points and through out everything else. The timeline in the books was whack too but I mean, They have thoroughly explain every part that has glossed over in the books and totally thrown out every other part... It is a good show but when they were making it they said that they wanted it to be a true representation of the books and they really just don&#39;t seem to have actually tried it. I also really do not like the characters representations. It makes me sad. I told myself not to expect too much and though I want to like it I really just don&#39;t The characters personalities and interactions are just not accurate. I mean Geralt and Dandelion(AKA buttercup) were friends and the book conveyed Geralt got excited to meet him in his journeys, not begrudgingly couldn&#39;t get rid of him.
I haven‚Äôt read the books, I plan to after watching the series. But from my perspective and taking into account what you said, I think that the adaptation was good. Yes they made changes, but from a story point of view it makes sense to add or remove parts for a more straightforward story. Yennifer having more scenes and a further expanded background makes sense when you consider that not all of the audience research the original story. Maybe after reading the books I‚Äôll change my views on it, but as of now, I think it‚Äôs a good adaptation.
I just see it like a gameplay of the witcher with an sjw mod and real life graphics
despite of many changes and couple of weird things they did i still really liked the show 8/10 for me cant wait for 2 season and im very familiar with the story i read the books multiple times.
I liked the show as entertainment, but for sure as a fan of the games, I have some gripes but overall I look forward to season 2. Since Game of thrones is done I really hoped for something in the ball park and this defiantly is. I think they need to pile more money into it. Vikings and The last kingdom seem to have better production quality and they really need that to not be the case. Also Jen and Triss casting choices seem crazy to me. There&#39;s so much nudity in the show it seems strange that why not just have Jen and Triss be better looking actress&#39;s and less naked women. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s many shows where the leading ladys  are not even close to the hottest ladys in the room. I mean Mr Cavel‚Ä¶.jesus hes not your average man that&#39;s for sure....
Although l respect your opinion of the show, l think people such as yourself who are unhappy with how this Witcher world is portrayed, should tread carefully, filmmakers such as Netflix are very sensitive to criticism, look what happened to the Marvel shows when people started criticising them, you could end up doing people a disservice by getting things off your chest, by getting Netflix so rattled they may rethink the seven seasons they have planned and that would be unfortunate for people who like the show, just something to bear in mind. Love the channel by the way, been a subscriber for some time.. Peace..
I really enjoyed it!
Tell me, Witcher. Do you bleed?
they push female poiwer in cost of important plot points i guess.
Imagine and create ur own show in ur mind with ur own cast then u won‚Äôt ave a prob with ur world be the god of ur own üåé
I&#39;ve only played the Wild Hunt,  the thing I loved the most about the game were the characters and the storytelling. Besides that I agreed with you on everything you said, the show made no sense to me on so many things, the storytelling was all over the place , just plain sloppy. I thought most of the cast did good with their characters despite the writing. Overall I&#39;d give it 6.5/10, a bit dissapointed. All I wanted was some good dialogues 1-2 fight scenes, a monster hunt. Would have sufficed.
Dude, every person is entitled to his or her own opinion, period. If someone is offended by someone else&#39;s opinion, that&#39;s their problem. <br>Your analysis was on point. You shouldn&#39;t have to apologize or put any disclaimers.
Love your content and totally understand your point of view. Different to mine but I can see where your coming from. I have a background in Classics so when I see TV shows or movies, that either embellish or make up content that strays from source material. It ruins the emersion and detracts from my enjoyment.
thank you ! I&#39;m not the only one who has this exact opinion !! xD Love the books and the games, so the changes really bothered me
What‚Äôs with all the Africans?
That ISNT Yen, its the princess from Aladdin, that ISN&#39;T Triss its a cheap diversity pick. but that aside this show is awesome watch it boys its not a bad adaption. But remember. It isn&#39;t Yen, it&#39;s not Triss. Its forced misguided diversity picks.
I agree with you, when it comes to the adaption of the story. And I think Geralt, Ciri &amp; the forest was an amazing story. But I went in open minded with the series as I knew it would be adapted sooner or later, like GoT
Henry isn&#39;t bad. But they watered down most of the characters and often changed their personalities. The diversity casting in this setting is dumb and distracting. Not sticking with obvious character descriptions was also dumb. I didn&#39;t expect them to recreate the books page for page. But they changed or left out some pretty important stuff.
Only problem I had was the dialogue being a little off putting and the three separate timelines not being clearly defined at the beginning.. The rest I highly enjoyed. That being said, my only prior experience was the witcher 3. So I have no knowledge on what was changed from the book.
Loved the games, but I could only stomach 2 episodes. Really bad acting, awful dialogue, it was made for teens 10/10 best series eva guyz, ugh üò¥
Netflix found their game of thrones
I agree with a lot of your points. <br>I have more the 800 hours in the all of the games, read all the books and comics and The Witcher has been on my mind daily for at least 3 years. I don&#39;t have a problem with the majority of the changes, I understand why the changes, but as a fan it&#39;s really hard to not notice when something is different, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s almost impossible to not notice a change. <br>The closer they get to the book, the better the episode. The original material is not as gripping as the book material. For example the whole Aretuza arc in episode 2 and 3 was not as exciting as the first episode. It&#39;s by no means bad but not as good as the source material. <br>I do think that they didn&#39;t take advantage of the Brokilon story, that story is great. <br>Also if they would had followed the short stories first and then the saga like in the books, I think that would had been better but they had to do it this way to not introduce main characters like Ciri that late (season 2). I get it but I don&#39;t see a problem with keeping it like in the books. <br>With Cahir I guess they needed a &quot;villain&quot; or something. He&#39;s more mysterious in the books but they can still get his character right in later seasons were he&#39;s more important. <br>I think it has more possitives than negatives, at least for me. I&#39;m liking it but something feels off, I wish I were enjoying it more, I should be way more excited but I&#39;m not that much and I hate that feeling. <br>In general I think it&#39;s a good show, but I guess being a massive fan was my biggest problem because, as you, I can&#39;t help to notice a change or expect something 100% true to the books and that&#39;s impossible. I&#39;m liking it but I&#39;m a bit underwhelmed. <br><br>P.S: I really like your honest opinions, I don&#39;t know why some people can&#39;t  take good criticism or ideas that are not as exactly as they though. Even though I agree with a lot of what you said, I don&#39;t have a problem with what I disagree on, and respect your opinion because it was presented with good arguments. <br>P.P.S: Sorry for the wall of text, also english is not my main language so sorry if there are some mistakes there.
A case where ignorance is bliss eh?
I totally agree with you on the Brokilon storyline. If they planned on taking the story that way then why have that plot line at all? Pointless and waste of time.<br>I think they did the character of Triss such a disservice.
The Witcher is trash in my opinion. I haven&#39;t read the books or played the game. Generally it&#39;s execution it&#39;s poor
TL:DR: They changed things so you didn&#39;t like it.
I enjoyed the show . I haven&#39;t read the books. I have played the games. But the casting of yeniffer and Triss was bad especially bad. I known they want the show to appeal to everyone to make money. So I understand and the swj rubbish was toned down a little compared to other shows. Its is probably the best witcher adaptation we are going to get. Garelt is brilliant, danilion is brilliant, ciri is promising. Hopefully the swj push will not get any stronger in the show otherwise it will completely reck what left.
Well it is not supposed to exactly follow the books. You would know everything that would happen. They just made their own version of it.
The only problem I have with this video is the way you talk about us fans makes it seem like the only way someone could like the show is if they were a Whiney fan boys that can‚Äôt take criticism. Just letting everyone know that it‚Äôs possible to enjoy the show from a critical perspective and, not just as a fan of the source material.
I do think you&#39;re comparing the two too closely. The show isn&#39;t meant to be the books, it&#39;s it&#39;s own entity. The books were more a guide line for them to create their own witcher story. I do have my strifes with it don&#39;t get me wrong, but I like it for what it is. And never be afraid of upsetting people because you have an opinion, that&#39;s the only part of this video that did annoy me.
Just one minor point regarding Vilgefortz, I think it was supposedly a mockup fight for show. They did not actually want to kill each other, just a &quot;shoot me in the leg&quot; kind of thing. V Killing the wounded mage was telling us he is not really on the side of the defending mages.<br><br>However, as a mage can basically blast someone that is out in the open without any magical defenses, I do not see how their fight would convince anyone of anything other than that magic often is weak.
Honestly, I am someone who played the games, but didn&#39;t read all the books.<br>Still, some characters and things already felt weird. Some looked good, but others... not so much.<br>There are a few things I felt were wrong where I now know: they are. <br><br><br><br>So I am conflicted. I don&#39;t hate it, but I also can&#39;t enjoy it to much. There are things that just take me out of the experience. I can&#39;t emerse myself in the series, because something takes me out, because I see an issue. Still, I don&#39;t regret watching it at the same time.
Thank you Witcher George. I couldn&#39;t agree more
It&#39;s an adaptation... Details such as fleshing out Yennefer&#39;s character was great for the viewers.
I think this was always going to happen, read Game of Thrones too and it&#39;s just a different thing entirely from the show, as Martin said himself due to time constraints, budget and trying to adapt it&#39;s impossible they will be the same.<br><br>Could it have been better of course, but I think we all know it could have been a lot worse too.<br><br>7/10 for me.
I loved the show and subscribed because of this video, you can appreciate hard work even if it doesn&#39;t coincide with your opinion.
I need to point out their use of the Tor Lara it&#39;s the place where they go to catch lightning and in the books it&#39;s the place full of chaos energy and it&#39;s a very unstable portal and knowing how it is important later on for Ciri i am confused as hell how will they used it later
Honestly, I went into this show knowing it probably wasn‚Äôt going to be faithful. I‚Äôm a huge fan of both the books and the games, however, I did like the show. The main reason I was able to was because I just thought of it as someone else‚Äôs interpretation of what I interpreted. Yes I know some of the major details were changed, I have my own annoyances with it like how they portrayed kahir or however you spell it I forget. But, I didn‚Äôt once think of this as a definitive version of the books. It was fun for me to watch this show because I was able to sit down and take joy in watching Geralt go through the situations I read about. Despite them being wrong in some places. Overall, despite the changes, it was a fun show.
I&#39;m gonna stop watching this. It&#39;s one thing to say the show&#39;s deviations are not as effective as the book&#39;s original plot points. I can agree with that. But to relentlessly complain about deviations from the source material simply because they aren&#39;t in the source material is sorry criticism. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s called adaptation and not recreation. In general, the best parts of the best adaptations are never the perfect recreation of something that already exists. If that&#39;s the only thing an adaptation has to offer, it&#39;s not a good adaptation. The best things about this show are the original moments. Yennefer&#39;s story, the shuffled timeline, etc, these are great experiences. The show goes wrong when it tries too hard to recreate the style of Sapkowski&#39;s prose. It simply doesn&#39;t lend itself to cinema. The show shines when it takes the initiative to create something new and fresh. But if you&#39;re too preoccupied with the story you think the show should be telling, with seeing a story you already know play out on screen exactly as you expected it, you&#39;re going to miss a vastly superior experience. <br><br><br>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a perfect show, or even a great show. It has its problems independent of its faithfulness to the source material. But if all you&#39;re looking for is faithfulness, you&#39;re just watching wrong.
My only problem is they didn&#39;t focus enough on geralt and I didn&#39;t like the actors that play Triss and yennefer
I think you would have gotten your point across better if you explained why their changes were bad instead of just saying &quot;they changed this&quot;.
I&#39;ve read the books several times and I still love the show.<br>It is your opinion and it is your right to have one. But this review basically sais &quot;This is a good show but I disliked everything that wasn&#39;t exactly like in the books and because of that I dislike it.&quot;
With the knowledge that I have from the books it was difficult to watch. But I think it&#39;s is easier to watch as something different.
I‚Äôve never played the games or read the books, but I didn‚Äôt really like direction they went with the show. It felt pretty rushed and there was a lot of scenes that felt wasted that could of been used better with the source material. Overall I still enjoyed the show and think it is a good story that I want to know more about, hopefully they get the feedback from the die hard fans like you for season 2 and give the Witcher the justice it deserves.
Sounds like really high expectations but your entire thing is Witcher lore so it‚Äôs understandable. Your issues are entirely story centric. I enjoyed it
Witcher George, there is a polish movie from the 2000s I think maybe earlier of the witcher its 2hrs long covers the events of the first book. It&#39;s in polish, but the the subs are in english. I saw it on youtube give us your opinion on this as well. Also shows alot about Geralt and his childhood though I am not sure how accurate that part is you also see the part where they did the extra mutations. Keep up the good work! Toss a coin to your witcher o valley of plenty!
It‚Äôs a ‚Äútv‚Äù show not a book
stop apologizing
It wasn‚Äôt what I expected, I mean a lot of things were changed for the worse yes, some things were great. Overall I didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much as I hoped but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs here. It will bring more fans to the Witcher universe, but if they wanna keep the old fans they need major improvement
I appreciate your honesty. I enjoy your videos especially because how much you know about this world. I know things but not as much as someone like you. I enjoy the show but treat it separately from the games and books. I‚Äôm choosing to look at the show and enjoy the ride but as something that is not canon exactly.
I mean the makers of the show said they were doing their own thing.  I&#39;m glad they remixed the story a bit and added their own parts.  It keeps things fresh.  LOVED Yennefer&#39;s whole story line.  I was already super impressed with her from Witcher 3. After seeing everything she&#39;s had to overcome, it makes her even more of a badass.
Yeah Vilgefortz.. the one of the most powerful mages and characters in Witcher univirse that almost killed Regis and Geralt was defeted by Cahir without even breaking a sweat like lmfao. And thats just one small thing that bothers me with the show. I agree with you George 100% on this review. Keep up the good work!
I don&#39;t think you are grasping what an adaptation is
Loved the books love the game love the show...
I just skipped all the scenes that didnt have gerald üòÖ
Just finished watching the show and I purposefully looked for a YouTube channel that also knows that show so I can fully understand what even is going on in the universe as some of the magic itself confused me. I came into the show with maybe a couple hours of game time in Witcher 3 and that‚Äôs it. The universe sounded interesting and the Witcher‚Äôs are pretty cool so I thought it would be a decent entry. I did enjoy the show and from how you described it it is because I do see it as a new fantasy show to watch. Even thinking about wanting to recommend it to friends I would describe it as a Game of Thrones type show with more magic, probably super heretical to anyone that loves the books or games lol, so I can see your standing on it. Sucks that it‚Äôs not a faithful adaptation or anything as that will probably drive the fans away, I don‚Äôt think you would voluntarily watch season 2 if that was announced based on your criticisms, and thus create a sort of wedge between fans of the books and games with the fans of the show. Hopefully not as bad as Last Jedi did with the Star Wars fan base. Maybe if this season does well the creators and writers may take more from the books and just wanted a more general season one for everyone to get the gist of magic and who‚Äôs who
Witcher george spitting fax
mages are too weak
Well.. I have a bit of a hard time with this video, I mean, what did you expect? A true replica of the books? each episode would be 9 hours long, and they have to make a show that people can enjoy, even though they can&#39;t recite the books perfectly from start to finnish. I have read the books aswell, and I actually think they did a good job, to present the intrigues. You keep talking about characters not explained well enough, and are a bit off from the books. Again, that would be 9 hours long episodes. To just make a youtube video pointing out what is different from the books is too easy, and not thought through. They presented the Witcher universe very nice, if you can&#39;t stand some creativity when someone has to make such a popular universe into episode of about 1 hour. Keep to the books and your own universe.
What I also found annoying was Yennefer arguing about abortion and how mages guild stole her ability to have children, but wasnt it her idea to have her appearence changed and agreed to exchange ability to bear children for that? Even that mage said that he would loose his head for doing it, because its forbidden. Like wtf woman, stop, it was your choice. In books I could understand, because all this story in Aretuza was unknown for us.
Love the books.. LOVED the Games... BUT i found the first season sooo confusing.. the timeline  for me... certainly  didnt work........i had to force myself to keep watching .. because i simply lost  orienting  bc of the jumps  forward/ back  without  just a small explanation  until the last part.......
It‚Äôs was good not great. I enjoyed it though. It‚Äôs an adaptation. They could‚Äônt include everything. Don‚Äôt be a book snob dude, jk. I too wanted the Geralt and Ciri scene In brokilon however she only 4 or 5 in the books so wouldn‚Äôt have the same feel. Overall happy with it they tried to tie all the short stories together. Solid 8/10
I respect your opinion but the part with yeneffer isnt farfatched at all. Everthing or nearly everything is written down in the books.
Im Polish and believe me you dont want to know how I feel and what I think about his show. The Books are everything to me and I just cant ignore the source material, just cant. The end line form was an introduction of Borg, after this I stopped watching. Peace.
I agree with you 100%. This show could be so much better if it hadn&#39;t made so many changes to the lore. The one aspect I also didnt like were so many &quot;epic fight scenes&quot;, which just didnt happen. I mean, I can understand the fight in Blaviken, but why the fight in the dragons lair?
I appreciate that you still put out this video even if you thought you would get lash back for it. Please don&#39;t stop putting out vids
I agree with you less on the liberties they took and more on those they didn&#39;t.  I like the golden dragon subplot from the book, but of everything they showed in the series, that&#39;s the biggest one I&#39;d have understood them nixing.  <br><br>There&#39;s a whole lot Netflix doesn&#39;t have the CGI budget to pull off with any kind of sincerity. I&#39;m happy to keep my expectations of the mythology grounded so long as you can write the story around it.   Funny enough, I thought the mother interaction was one of the better efforts in that endeavor. <br><br>But I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m more attached to game Ciri than show or book Ciri. Half of me is hoping for a different actress post KM.
I completely understand your review and I agree with a lot of your critiques. Feels like they got caught between being just a mainstream fantasy story or being the story of the Witcher. But the casting imo is excellent, and a linear story in S2 would elevate the series
I enjoyed the show for what it was. I read the Last Wish and the Sword of Destiny like 5-6 years ago, and I even noticed that there were a lot of changes in the stories. I think the show could have benefited from focusing more on the short stories and left most of Ciri&#39;s story for season 2 plus. The butcher of blavikin story really did miss the tension that was in the books. Geralt trying so hard to maintain his &quot;neutrality&quot; but ultimately forced to pick a side making him choose the &quot;lesser evil&quot;. I really did enjoy the stuff with Yennefer tho. It really shows how her past molded her personality. It makes sense why she&#39;s such a bitch seeing at the intense trauma she endured during her childhood and adolescence. I think the show would have benefited greatly by showing Kaer Morhen and the Witcher trials. I feel like new comers would be kinda confused as to what Witchers were capable of. There really isn&#39;t an explanation other than they&#39;re &quot;mutants&quot;. That doesn&#39;t really explain much. I think the biggest problem with the show was that it tried to do so much and really missed a lot of world building. I kinda compare this to season 1 of GOT which is arguable the best season because it is slower paced and really goes into detail about the world, the characters, and the stakes.
I totally <a href=""http://agree.it/"">agree.It</a> was a bad adaptation,it spit to the face of orgrinal books.
I agree with all the inconsistencies ya pointed out but I still enjoyed the show as a overall, they did a great job capturing the tone. Hope they get a chance to correct some of the more fixable mistakes in the second season. That said I really hope they overhaul how they handle Nilfgaard going forward the only thing they did good on them was there formal attire, and god you didnt even mention their terrible armor designs.
I came from the game universe and only know bits and pieces of the book. I know the TV show is more based on the book, so I tried to isolate my biases coming from the games. But in my honest opinions, the show is not well made even if it had nothing to do with the book nor the game. I think the faults lies in the character development and story telling.<br><br><br>The show is filled with characters without proper development. People say things out of the blue, without proper motives. Half way through the show, I&#39;m asking myself &quot;how many times do they need to use the word DESTINY&quot;. Real people do not talk like that. It became such an empty cringe word that it loses its significance because it was used so loosely. I felt most of the minor characters, or even the main ones, do not say things or do things because the world that they lived in, the situation they are in and the relationship they had with others demanded they speak or act a certain way. <br><br><br>On the contrary, the game (Witcher 3 + DLCs) was on the absolute opposite of the spectrum. Every single person living this fantasy world had their own motives, are affected by the world events and your actions. They speak genuinely and acted exactly as you expected them to act. I still shed tears revisiting the story of the bloody baron because I knew how much it made sense (sad sense), that he chose to take his life having gone through the whole quest sequence. <br><br><br>The writers of the show really have to take the blame for this one. Henry Cavil did as good a job as he could; the fights were awesome and the cinematography was beautiful. But with bad character development and lackluster story telling, I don&#39;t see how this is better than the Warcraft movie or the Transformers.
I haven&#39;t read the books but I&#39;m a big fan of the game, must of played it true about five times now.  I have loved following your channel all this time as you have enriched my experience and make every time I play the game more real because it all makes sense and fits together. When I watch the TV show I&#39;m not feeling the world as being well thought out or believable, magic and monsters aren&#39;t common place and a witcher or sorceress have little or no role in this world. I will always have the witcher I love as a separate story, richer move believable as the show is confusing and characters motivations not well thought-out or believable.
I loved the show but totally open to hearing your thoughts ! Haha I haven‚Äôt read the books but would love to . My stepdad read two books and filled in some gaps for me . I plan on also replaying The Witcher 3 - I‚Äôve watched a lot of your lore videos and some others that also helped me understand some stuff . Very cool to hear your points ! I‚Äôm sad that the show didn‚Äôt fit for you cuz I‚Äôm really enjoying it but I totally understand your points for not reallyyyy liking it
Not a fan of the series.  SPOILER ALERT!!! Like you I read the books, about as often as I read Dune till I thought I was part of the House Atreides. I was a bit disturbed by what was cut out and what was expounded, and the confusing timelines. Big, BIG chunks of events are gone: the Temple of Melitele where Geralt spent most of in the Last Wish, The Eternal Fire, and considering boobs are aplenty, where is Shinaaz and her perfect breasts and the Duke? Episodes 1 was weak without the Tridam Ultimatum and what was presented is WHO is the lesser evil: Renfri or Stregobor. Episodes 2 and 3 expounded on characters that played a minor role: Istredd. I was fine with changing a few things if it improves the source material. Too bad the writer isnt Frank Darabont or someone similar. The changes only made the book more appealing. Episode 4 broke me. I hated the take on A  Question of Price. It was weak, compared the The Hexers&#39; take on the story: no screaming Pavetta, instead we have on where she spouts Elder speech in the air. I think they crammed Nivellens story in it, being Beauty and The Beast plot. Episode 5 lacks that chemistry between Geralt and Yen, and just went straight to boning each other after the djinn attack. Then we got a damaged house instead of a ravaged town. Episode 6: Villentretenmerth the golden chicken, and no Doregarray. Seven and Eight were alright, bit close to the books, Vilgefortz was very interesting and Geralt mentions Vesemir. Those alone got me interested in Season 2.
Thank you for your clarifications! I learnt so much that I didn&#39;t know from the books and various lores. Really appreciate itüòä
So your logic here is, it&#39;s a bad show because it&#39;s different from the original story that comes from the book.<br><br>You&#39;re just comparing, this is not a review.
A small detail that bothers me strangely hard is the moment when the first boyfriend of yennefer ( I forgot the name ) just opens a portal in tor Lara like it is nothing.<br>If u know the books u are aware of the fact that he in his first scene sent yennefer to certain death.<br>The tower of the swallow/tor Lara contains an ancient portal which disturbs and disorients every other portal and transforms it into a chaotic portal.<br>It&#39;s even a essential plot point in the main story of Ciri.<br>I see the same problems as George, the writers changed and ignored key details in the story what in the long run completely changes the long time story.<br>The show is like the games making up its own story but about events which already known from the books.<br>That&#39;s just creates a whole mess of confusing event&#39;s.<br><br>And yea English isn&#39;t my native language...
I personally loved it. But nevertheless, the fans of the books who didn&#39;t enjoy this season as much as the other fans should still be respectful towards the showrunner and the cast and give honest criticism so that they can make a second season that will please everyone. We rarely get any decent fantasy adaptations these days, we should at least make sure this one doesn&#39;t flop and instead keeps improving and eventually give us a Witcher adaptation that even the pickiest of fans will come to love.
The idea of making a video of all the things that were changed in the TV show is not so bad. Especially, since lists are popular.<br>&quot;35 that TV witcher show differs from the books&quot;
the characters were better portrayed in the games, which aren‚Äôt a direct adaptation, than the tv shows that are supposed to be adapting the books. the witcher could have been a truly epic television series... i wish it had been handled by more seasoned writers and not by Netflix, because they don‚Äôt really have much experience with these sorts of shows. guess they gotta start somewhere, i just wish it wasn‚Äôt with my favorite franchise haha
Also Vilgefortz‚Äôs line of mistaking the reflection of the starts in the pond for the night sky was stolen by Frangila
The author of the book helped &quot;make up&quot; the yennefer story. You said they implied Yennefer wouldve ruined nilfgaard but thats wrong. ONLY ONE person said that. There were other people that said if they wouldve had her there everything wouldnt have been so bad. So i think if ANYONE knows her mysterious background, its the author. You said &quot;unnecessary changes&quot; but you have to realize in shows there has to be a protagonist and antagonist. If nilfgard was portrayed as what they were in the book, it wouldnt have built the suspense to the GENERAL public. Us core fans are always going to have  problems with book adaptations.  I like it because of the characters. I dont even care if they keep it going with all made up stories as long as the author is still involved.<br><br><br>Yeah i didnt like the timeline jumping and stories were a bit off and outright missing. But this show jumps around so much i wouldnt doubt season 2 is all the previous stuff and the big after geralt and ciri meet.
I agree with You, with my Polish long term take on those books and story. They fucked it up, especially the narrative and single characters in this context. But also the details of that unique Witcher world and as a result of that their story seems ridiculous.
I like this show. They chose some typical world from young-adult fantasy novels and that&#39;s ok for me. I think that after hire Henry Cavill and spending money on special effects, they no longer had money for more.
Just found your channel. I think your opinion matters a lot because of how invested you are into the books and lore. They are thoughts and opinions that people should hear, and maybe if enough people share a certain opinion it can have a positive change in the future of the show.<br><br>That bieng said, I barely have context to books and only a slight connection to the games and I really enjoyed the show. It has some issues, most of them are pacing issues. Sometimes I stopped caring about what was happening because it was just boring exposition or uninteresting dialogue. And I really disliked that season is just a stepping stool for season 2. It almost feels like you could skip season 1 entirely and just be try to connect the dots in season 2.
I think later on season 2-3 they will show Geralts back story... it only makes sense how it all went down. Like now how he is this mysterious tough guy. but eventually slowly over time they will do flashbacks! Also i think they need to tell us when is the past when is the present.. A bit confusing at times tbh
I understand your frustration but change is not always bad. For example the red wedding in GOT has alot of changes that played a good role in making GOT famous.
I agree with the adaptation being imperfect, but I am used to it from other adaptations of other franchises, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much.. loved the show, as I was able to differentiate..
As someone who‚Äôs first experience with the world of the Witcher was Witcher 3, then the last wish and since a lot of research about the world including this Chanel I actually really enjoyed the show, I guess because I haven‚Äôt read all the books my views of certain story‚Äôs haven‚Äôt been cemented yet as I‚Äôve only heard of them through dialog in the game or I guess these videos. I was very sceptical of the show at first and didn‚Äôt have very high hopes from the trailers, the casting was really my main concern. triss is horrible, the rest honestly didn‚Äôt bother me that much but overall I enjoyed watching it and I‚Äôm glad that I have another way to experience the Witcher world, even if it may be changed from the source material. The other thing I really like about the show is that it brings new fans, my buddy‚Äôs grandparents even started watching it. So I think it really benefits everyone whether they‚Äôre into the show or not, It is making the franchise and world we love all the more popular. And I do hope they make more ballads for dandelion
ya gotta stop apologising my guy, you presented good points but I still don‚Äôt agree, no bad blood lol
i had a reaction just like yours when i watched les miserables with hugh jackman. like, very importants parts were cut off and made the film so awkward for me. and the film is so slow and boring.<br><br>but i like the show of netflix with the witcher. i know it has changes compared to the book, but it was very enjoyable to watch in my experience. the show made me want to play the games again.
Have people really become so pathetic and hysterical that you need to apologise for having a different opinion in advance nowadays?
When has a TV series/Movie ever been the same as the books?
DO A NIT PICK VIDEO!
well, the netflix one is just a remake of the hexer, the old series that fail..so it would be very hypocritical of anyone to say the netflix one is a triumph, it even have the same opening and the same ending which is not what happened in the books...Ciri running around in the woods for nothing must take at least a week and they made it equel to geralt fighting neckers, get bitten and sleeping in the back of a carriage? that would only take one night time at the most, I dont even have to be a fan of the Witcher anything to point out that this show is shit
I do prefer the books. I did enjoy the show and am looking forward to season 2
They made changes in an adaptation?!?!
Now the real question is which movie/show is worst or best.<br>The Hexer or The Witcher Netflix series?<br>Both being the same thing that is a  adaptation of the Witcher.
Thank you for your honest opinion
That creator Lauren Schmidt Hissrich bitch fcked it up.. Her fcking liberal political views forced this character diversity on this show which fucked it up.. I&#39;m Asian, and I dont mind if the show is all white if it&#39;s appropriate for the setting.. and then she tries too hard to make it seem like a clever plot, by having all these unecessary timelines, backstories, and then this rushed character developments.. argghh.. I hate that bitch for fucking this up..
I know, I‚Äôm that guy but I don‚Äôt care anymore. The casting sucked. Especially the females. Black Fringella. Indian yennefer. Maya Rudolph as Triss...This wouldn‚Äôt matter if they were good actresses but Yen is only passable actress. Immersion broken.  I was skeptical about Cahvill but he did alright. It‚Äôs passable<br>For entertainment but I can understand the major story gripes from die hard fans.
i am on episode 7 amd im already disappointed in this show.. poor story, so much unnecessary nudity, weird action scenes, the only main character that i like is the Witcher--Henry Cavil, his acting is really good. overall show is disappointing.
I don&#39;t get the whole &quot;It&#39;s okay for the video games to have different lore, but not the TV show&quot; stance.
So last episode Yennefer was combined with another sorceress, right? Like in the Witcher 2 there&#39;s a sorceress that burns down an entire field... I don&#39;t think Yennefer ever did that.
My opinion is that you have no right to your opinion
I can say that they really really tried. And it&#39;s good enough. We should be happy to have that show. My only strong dislike would be not explaining timelines at all and make it very difficult to track it.
Fringilla and triss are the biggest disappointments, makes no sense
I have never read the books or played the games.<br>I watched it completely pure of bias.<br><br>My biggest issue with the series was the time jumping.<br>Immersion was consistently broken because you&#39;d be watching a scene for like 3 minutes, thinking &quot;what the hell is happening? where are they?&quot; only for them to FINALLY give you some indication that you&#39;re actually YEARS in the past.<br>I didn&#39;t notice any visible indication of aging so it always felt like it must be the present time.<br><br>What makes the time jumping particularly bad is that it happens far too often and at seemingly random points in an episode WITH NO INDICATION that we&#39;re seeing the past now, or, the present now.<br><br>The other biggest flaw I had was the casting for Yennefer.<br>Remember I have no preconceived idea of what she should look like.<br>The problem was the show was constantly telling me and showing me that she&#39;s very very attractive, but, my eyes are telling me she&#39;s not.<br>Immersion breaking.<br><br>Beyond those two things it&#39;s minor issues, like; the hedgehog man (or whatever he was supposed to be). Just looked terrible.
So you want a completely adaption? That will never happen man everyone has there vision on how something looks like.That u must respected
as someone new to the lore of witcher, I didnt noticed the lore issues. but the other issues like africans in medieval europe and the war against red heads pop up. But I like it but could see the agendas.
I feel like they are catering towards the majority of the fan base of the Witcher series, which are the people who play the games. lets be honest, how many of us who plays the games read all of the books and is a lore nut to a high degree. we might enjoy some lore videos and information but most of us don&#39;t read the books. but all in all a great video. My only gripe against the show is the ciri story and how they made nilfgaard look shit and too evil, I mean look at the armor
I just watched it in one sitting. It&#39;s pretty amazing imo. The actions scenes actually pretty great, arguably one of the best one in any movies/shows this year. I kinda like &amp; welcomed the new stuffs like Yennefer&#39;s backstory &amp; the details in battle of Sodden Hill. I think this is 8.5/10 imo. Also:<br>- the Nilfgaard armors still awful, but the cover of darkness &amp; nights in most of the scenes actually somewhat &quot;removed&quot; that awful wrinkles (LOL) &amp; actually works as intended as a terrorizing/invaders army. Still though, I really hope they changed it for season 2 like some kind of massive upgrades or something.<br>- Kinda disappointed how they depict dryads so far. Again, Eithne supposed to be &quot;non-human&quot; &amp; truly majestic! Yes, some of the dryads are past human &amp; elves, but there are actual race of dryad!! This is a massive mistake imo ...<br>- tbh, I am a bit conflicted with the big changes around how Geralt &amp; Ciri met. On one hand I totally understand why the show did it, especially with such a tight time for a show. Also, I think this is also something to do with the Ciri cast itself with only &quot;adult teen&quot; role actress. This is also will make sense &amp; more &quot;safe&quot; for the show if Netflix wanna do some flashbacks with &quot;the adventure in Skellige.&quot; On the other hand, there must be a better way to do it with some slight changes &amp; I really think putting one special episode with a younger Ciri (as in child actress) that revolve around the actual first time both Geralt &amp; Ciri met in Brokilon forest.<br>+ I totally love the intro logo of each episodes. This kind of things are just pure fan service.<br>+ Geralt &amp; Jaskier/Dandelion dynamic is totally perfect imo LOL<br>+ Best episode is definitely Lesser Evil<br>+ Netflix should make a 12 episodes for season 2!!!<br><br>I would wager that fans of the books or the games or both will likely enjoy this show very much, while some of the newcomers might be stumbled a little bit at first viewing &amp; I hope this people give another viewing to really assemble the stories much better with the time jumps. That&#39;s it.
As someone who only played the games I‚Äôm pretty disappointed by the show I have to say though that the show has kind of made me want to read the books.
The books are the books, the games are the games, and the show is the show. They are all interpretations of the idea of Geralt, Witchers and that world. The novels obviously are the cleanest of these, coming straight from the source: the author. But, as long as any adaptation of that work keeps the heart and message of that work at its center it will succeed. I don&#39;t know a lot about Geralt outside of the games, I don&#39;t know a lot about his backstory or background. But, I do understand that the core of the story is about fate and family and choices. The show, despite changing things around adding unnecessary touches and what not, nails that. They have created a version of these characters that works in its own version of the world. By saying &quot;well they changed this so its bad&quot; what we are saying is that individual moments that don&#39;t actually matter to the overall feel and purpose of the story, are more important than the feel and purpose of the story. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter if all of the Yen stuff is invented for the show. In fact it helps people who DON&#39;T know the books and games to identify with her struggles and understand why she becomes a mother figure for ciri, why she becomes Geralts love. Because they can see and understand where she came from, outside of her interactions with them. <br>The same goes for their version of ciri where the books hinted, or told, the netflix series has decided to show. Which is good. It helps us feel for and understand this ciri. <br><br>Anyway. Thanks for the review. I get it, seeing something you love changed in ways that don&#39;t need to happen can be rough. But underneath that is still the ingredients that make the witcher the witcher. The end product looks like the witcher, it sounds like the witcher, it feels like the witcher. To me thats what matters.
Ah, I see you&#39;re another witcher of culture as well.
The nilfguarudian using forbidden magic was strange however Girls were turned into eles to power aratezua and that seems pretty evil and that took place in the northen realms so I think that&#39;s the duality of the witcher universe
Thank you! They destroyed yan and ciri for me there is zero emotional connection between the 3. From the books its not really destiny but long time development made geralt become a father figer in ciri and yan mother to ciri! And her amazing relationship with gerat!
My only real problems with the show are the casting for triss/fringilla actually terrible. Yen is Indian which also doesnt fit her in the books/game HOWEVER her actress plays yen very well so I can get used to it. Ciri also seems off isnt her hair ashen not blonde?<br><br>Oh yeah and nilfgaard armor looks like a scrotum.
The dislikes are coming from your opinion necessarily. Only that every justification for it being ‚Äúnot good‚Äù is rooted in the fact that it isn‚Äôt a carbon copy of the source. You‚Äôll always be let down if you expect any show or movie to be exactly like a book.
I haven&#39;t play the game, nor read the book.  The Netflix series is the first time I see The Witcher, and I like it.  Not as engaging as game of throne because I think the acting aren&#39;t as good and the flow of the show isn&#39;t easy to catchup to until you figured out what they&#39;re trying to do later in the season.  The show is base on the book if I recall correctly, because people were saying Yennefer doesn&#39;t appear until The Witcher 3(?).  I&#39;m going to play the game and read the book(s) after this show because the world in the Witcher is very interesting.
the aesthetic looks too clean..ya know?
I like the show. Maybe because i only played the witcher 3. Ignorance is a bliss i guess.
The Witcher show is taking a huge dump on the books for me. Firstly the cast for Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, Jaskier and Moussack is pretty spot on and they are the reason why I continue to watch the show. The banter between Geralt and Dandelion is quite funny and its a real positive for the show.  Unfortunately from there things go downhill, the casting for everybody else is atrocious, Fringilla, Eithne, Triss, Calanthe. No effort has been made to even make these people look like their characters. Lore wise Fringilla being black makes no sense and as for all the other black actors it is rather jarring to see them in the Witcher universe. Apart from the Zerrikanians there should be no black people in the show and even then the books describe the Zerrikanians as tan not African level black. As for having a black elf or Cintrian it makes no sense since from the books and games we are given no indication that there are people who even look like this. The problem for me is Lauren Hissrich said they would stay faithful and respectful of the books yet at every opportunity they cast non white actors as some sort of diversity push. This diversity isn&#39;t even needed since there are many species in the Witcher universe which if they wanted to could cover some sort of racism that way. I&#39;d like to add I hold nothing personal against these actors its just it really breaks the immersion when watching the show after having read the books and played the games. <br><br>The fight scenes with the monsters are perfect and Henry Cavill is doing great as Geralt. The costume design of people is a 50/50 for me. What the fuck is with the Nilfgaardian armour, an empire that can near conquer the known world and they have armour that looks like fried chicken spray painted black, piss poor to be honest. Also what the fuck is with the Dryads? Green skin with bow and arrows? Nope just some random women with spears and one crossbow, does the showrunner even care about what they are putting out, are they even trying at this point? <br><br>The timeline in terms of jumping back and forth gets a tad annoying and it seems a tad rushed though I already know what is going on, very disappointing that they cut out Geralt and Ciri in Brokilon and their relationship doesn&#39;t feel as genuine. The splitting up of the focus more so onto Yen and Ciri seems to be doing some harm to the flow of the show but I&#39;m not sure what I think of that yet. As for the battles between the human realms id would say they are pretty good, Sodden was a bit of a disappointment though. Jaskier again does it for me I&#39;m loving his character, overall id give this season a 4-5/10. The main problem for me is the cast and some elements of the series which look like they haven&#39;t even tried or cant be bothered to make something plausible. In the end Geralt and his companions really seem to be carrying the show. Oh and one thing I hate is my boy Cahir is just evil now and his armour looks like shit? Why are they treating him like a bad evil antagonist who just likes killing people when his character has never been like that and Ciri is only scared of him because of his armour. Cahir is meant to be an honourable knight not some run of the mill evil killer.
So much nitpicking. Tolkien&#39;s novels are pretty much the reason I live. The movies are by no means perfect but I love them for what they are, and understand that movies and series have to take liberty&#39;s with the source material. I was worried that the witcher show was going to be trash, but I was pleasantly surprised. Ofc the books will always be superior, that&#39;s just the way it is, be it lotr, got or witcher. And the author seems genuinely happy with what the achieved.
i feel like so much could be cut out of the show. like 80% of yennefer stuff.
Wanted to see more of geralt. Felt like yennefer had more screen time.
i respect ur opion but i still love the the witcher netflix . 9/10 i dont mind if they change the character or the story . all that matter&#39;s to me is good story and world building . peace
Only got halfway through the review. I get it. You live this stuff, so small changes really bother you. Also they didn&#39;t develop stuff enough. I wish it could have been 3x longer, too, but you know... reality. I enjoyed the show and I&#39;m glad they&#39;re making more. I haven&#39;t read the books yet, but now I probably will.
Called it. Wiki boy is just riding the popularity train lol. You&#39;d though he will never even watch a single episode the way he shat on it in previous videos.
Preach some more mate!!... It&#39;s really ridiculous how Cahir beat vilgefotz... Geralt can&#39;t even land a single blow to vilgefortz because that mage is extremely powerful and good in fighting. Cahir??? even black out and beg geralt not to kill him when he saw how fast geralt massacred those scoia&#39;tael in front of him... this show gives yennefer more importance than geralt and its B.S... its a fine show not good not bad but when it come to the lore? the fook it and shove it down our throats. :/
No offense to you Witcher George but I do have a very different opinion on this than you. As someone who has also enjoyed the books as well as the games, I find the show to be a nice fresh take. If all the events happened exactly the same in the show as it did in the books there would be no reason to watch, there would be no surprise. Events in shows, movies, and games, are changed often for a number of reasons and one of those reasons is to keep the material fresh for fans of the source material. If you look at the show and the games as alternate stories from the books I think you could find enjoyment in it as well. As it stands the only real canon stories in the Witcher universe are the books and only the books, the rest is just fun.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve every read a book then watched the movie thinking that it will be a copy and paste from book to movie. Or book to tv I like it for wat it is. That sucks you don‚Äôt seems like since your so deep in the lore u can‚Äôt get on board which is fine.
All adaptations should not be compared to its source material. Written media wil always be the better one because you have an unlimited budget; imagination. As a story the series was eh. Overall a fun action adventure but some inconsistencies with magic and it&#39;s power and the outright vilification of Fringilla and nilfgard was just old timey high fantasy especially in a post game of thrones era of story telling and character development.
Of course it&#39;s different it has to be, Anymore  GOT was also missing heaps of stuff from the books. TV can never match the detail provided in books it&#39;s a different medium. Is it perfect of course not, but have they captured the world and feel of The Witcher I think so.
There were WAY more positives than negatives! <br><br>You dont have to love it... but it isn&#39;t trash
Vilgefortz would&#39;ve wiped the floor with Cahir! Are you kidding me?? So many missed opportunities. Where&#39;s Nievellen? That was one of the best short stories. This when backstory of Yen is just overplayed and dragged out. Dont get me wrong, you&#39;re right George... you can like this show if you want but if you&#39;ve read the books you can&#39;t but help be dissatisfied. I mean it&#39;s okay but all the dissimilarities is just annoying. AND WHY THE HELL DIDNT WE GET ZOLTAN CHIVAY LOL<br><br>Hey it ain&#39;t all bad man but it&#39;s just hard to really get into when so much of it is just outright wrong. But it&#39;s a witcher inspired show, not a show based on witcher
Ive only read the first three books and played TW2 and TW3 and I still enjoyed it although the glaring inaccuracies bothered me. The first of the them that really stuck with me was Ciri&#39;s journey and how her and Geralt never met in the Brokilin forest. It pretty much negated her entire experience there. The orgy Geralt walks into to meet Yennefer was jarring, like why even remotely add that? It was completely pointless and wasnt in the books. The chemistry between Geralt and Yen was strong, but the execution was off. Overall it was still enjoyable but the unnecessary changes left a bitter taste in my mouth
I thought the implication was not that Yen would mess up in Nilfgard. She‚Äôd be there working against them when they got too strong.
you care too much about what other people think. Its your channel. Too much of this video was you apologizing. Just say what you want.
Sounds like a whole lot of a little bitch complaining in an English accent
i dont agree with you about Yennefer.. having her background extended (all that was shown is actually mentioned in books - her being hunchback, with stepfather selling her to Aretuza) and shown was great.  Lots of stuff you criticize were necessary from TV making reason - its problematic having children working on a TV show full time due to working laws, thats why Ciri is older. thats why they had to change Brokilon story and other stuff as well. (but yeah, they did not had to even show Brokilon, it was kinda weakest part of the show) And without Yennefer background story, whole thing about her wanting to have baby, or addopting one eventually would be quite flat if there was no explanation... <br><br><br>Nilfgaard being poor kingdom is also correct. they were poor kingdom originally until Emhyr came and conquered all southern kingdoms making it into powerful empire. but yes, different mage helped with it, but they couldnt just drop that bomb in the first season.<br><br><br>Regarding Foltest, again, portrayal in TV show is fine - he was completely wrecked after Adda died, he fled the Vizima, and let it be hunting ground for Striga.. If it wasnt for Geralt, he would most likely drank himself into grave.. but lifting the curse from young Adda saved the kingdom and gave him strength to go on.. yet, as you know, Foltest was not a &quot;positive character&quot; in books, he and other kings had their own plans with Ciri if they managed to get her first... so showing him fat (even though when they show him standing he isnt) and  drunk is perfectly fine...<br><br><br>Personally what i missed the most was Phillipa Eilhart.. kinda expected her to be at Aretuza when decision to go to Sodden was made.. anyway it makes sense why Vilgefortz was the one leading the mages considering his motives that we will learn later..
I didn‚Äôt realize who that Nilfgardian guy was supposed to be. <br>I didn‚Äôt all mind them making up Yens backstory. Thought that was great. <br>They ruined the jackdaw story. <br>A lot they changed majorly from the book was annoying. The scenes in Brokylon looked awful. Probably spelled a bunch wrong. I ‚Äúread‚Äù the books on audible.
Never read the books only played the games and... I love it! I thought it was amazing!!!! I want so much more!
It‚Äôs fucking amazing!!!!
Star Wars Theory I loved Rise of Skywalker!. everyone else I hate Rise Skywalker.<br>WitcherGeorge I not Fan of the Show!  everyone else I love The Witcher!<br><br><br>Classic.
I would like to know your opinions on Episode 5 which of all episodes I felt was most truly ‚ÄúWitcherlike‚Äù of all episodes, I felt of all the episodes captured the characters closest to the books, again not perfect, but closest? Would you agree or disagree, mate?
I really was not a fan at all. The writers ruined a show with so much potential in my opinion. Great video pal.
Unpopular opinion here: what if the books are actually not gospel-good and what the show is doing works out? True, Ciri&#39;s story seemed mostly pointless and forced by &#39;destiny&#39;, but I rly liked what they did with other characters, like Yen, Caranthe and even Frinigilla.
A nicely put together review and on so many point I totally agree with you and I‚Äôd love it to be closer to the books like you or even better exactly like the books, but I am unsure that they would have sold it to NetFlix or if they did, new comers to The Witcher would not have invested the required time into a TV Show to get to know Geralt. So although I know it‚Äôs not perfect or even close I enjoyed it, I feel we are left with either this or never having a Witcher series, so we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know it‚Äôs not perfect or even close but I can watch and get something out of it, it‚Äôs not the ‚Äútrue‚Äù Witcher, it‚Äôs just NetFlix Witcher. But I respect your opinion and understand where you are coming from with them, mate. Thank you for reading mine.
As for someone who has read the books and played the games. I personally thought that the show was good not amazing but good. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the cast roles for example such as Triss but Henry Canvill was great as Geralt not exactly how I imagine Geralt but it was a damn good version of him. Some of the writing was alright and the action was good. So I don‚Äôt think it was too bad. I‚Äôm still used to the fantastic  writing and style of what CD project red made from the Witcher.
So your issue with it is that its not a 1:1 recreation.
Stop being so overly concerned with peoples comments. You spent 5 minutes atleast begging people to not get upset.
Henry cavill was great. Show overall is like a 7. They coulda set up the episodes a lot better and the dialog was kinda ass. If I hear destiny in one more line Ima smack a hoe.
Really due to how uninspired and rehearsed the dialogue sounded. I found it too much to handle coupled with my idea of Geralt....
I think you&#39;re spot on in saying that it is a matter of taste. I&#39;m also a big fan of the books &amp; consider myself a Witcher lore nerd but I enjoyed the show more than I hated it. Despite the many unecessary changes, there were also moments in Geralt&#39;s story line in the show where it was pretty spot on with the image I had in my head while I was reading the books. I like that they also included some direct quotes, and I noticed myself smiling every time I recognized a quote (or similar line) from the books. To me, those little &quot;homages&quot; brought me the satisfaction of being a book reader and watching this series. I think it&#39;s OK for book readers to have different feelings on the show based on their personal taste and takeaways from the book series.
WitcherGeorge, you make verry good pionts. However, I liked season one. Like all shows based on books it has flaws. Also, Netflix mention that their version was going tell the story through Ciri,Yennefer, and Geralt. Emergency Awesome <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goU_L6Nrxj8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goU_L6Nrxj8</a> goes more in detail why the changes. I&#39;m just hoping now the characters have been introduced, Netflix want have to do rush job during season 2.
Just get to the point. Wth
I‚Äôm sorry, but if anyone thought it accurately displayed the Witcher books than they are objectively wrong. There are huge differences from the books and they completely make up multiple story lines. Countless details are needlessly changed. As a huge fan of the books I cannot get on board with much of their vision of the books.
There is novel lore TV lore, video game lore, comic book lore, and cinematic lore that&#39;s the way of the world now. Where ever you get into entertainment it&#39;s a great place to get new stories with characters you love. The show was good The book is better the game is the best.
Even IF you only played the games, it can&#39;t be considered &quot;just a bunch of stories involving Geralt&quot;. The show changes enough of the books that it doesn&#39;t even connect to the games properly even though I haven&#39;t read them - Foltest... equivalent exchange for magic... for instance. I do not want to taint my Witcher gameplay experiences so I will consider it a fan fiction with a decent Geralt.<br><br>I will say that Geralt was better than I thought. Cavil did well although he didn&#39;t have the neutral tone of Geralt just right. But it worked well enough.
Nobody cares about the books anyway.
never read the books, only played witcher 3. I realize the first book is just short stories, but the show seems disjointed and random at times, with the only thing even keeping me watching was to see Geralt and Ciri unite... Yeneffer&#39;s story line was eh. The mages story line could have been developed way better.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=5m45s"">5:45</a> That whole &#39;Nilfgaard is a poor, weak, backwater nation&#39; nonsense is simply a shitty &amp; lazy plot device that the idiot producers &amp; writers came up with to explain that HORRIBLE looking ballsack armor.<br>Honestly, the original Polish TV series &quot;The Hexer&quot; is looking like a much more accurate and better produced adaption this the 8 episodes of this trash we got.
No need to start every video with apologizing for your free speech. Not your fault per se, but that&#39;s the society we live in today unfortunately.
I think Calanthe described Nilfgaard as a backwater place just because she is a &quot;B,&quot; not that they are really a backwater place that only uses dark magic. I respect your opinion, love and respect the channel in general, never read the books, but played all 3 games and like the show but don&#39;t love it.  I didn&#39;t like the 1st season of game of thrones at all. I&#39;m excited to see what season 3 brings.
You know witcher fandom is massive and widespread we can make another witcher series that actually accurate and no as white-washing and brain-washing as this is ... I mean it&#39;s been done before with the youtube fanfilm and low budget is better than this piece of trash and the only... ONLY criticism I have is the language barrier...I for 1 would willing to give up $50 per month to support it
I am amazed at how much people like the show. Let&#39;s not compare it to the books, the writing in the show is just mediocre at best :(
Cringe moment with using Aard and kissing the Yen, and that embarrassment of Dragon. Except that things i liked the show.
Looks like a good number of limp-wristed fantasy soy boys didn&#39;t like your review, which can only mean that you&#39;re over the target with your thoughts about the show. And yes, the show is a woke dumpster fire, and I haven&#39;t even bothered to watch it.
You can still like something and find faults in it <br><br>That was the privilege of being a SW fan before 2012
I liked the show :/ not too big on the books but I played the games and I thought it was alright. I knew before hand it wasn‚Äôt going to be that accurate to the books because come on it‚Äôs Netflix what do you expect lol. Either way I wanted to see the opinion of someone who‚Äôs read the books on the show thanks for the extra info
In the perfect world, yeah, 100% agree on your opinion, however I understand all  the changes necessary for making this into a TV show.  Expecting a fully faithful adaptation was the mistake here (as they already had talked about a couple of book changes being necessary)
Awe man that‚Äôs too bad, unfortunately I think the people who followed the books the most and really dug through will have the hardest time enjoying it. I hope further down in future seasons the good parts can give you something to at least enjoy to some degree. Personally don‚Äôt consider any of the changes ridiculous, just hard to not notice. I can see how these things needed to change for show though. Especially Yen‚Äôs solo stuff, the show is really helped by it where without it the show (and the character) would feel thin.
you ignored the biggest issue, there wasn&#39;t one damn gwent reference
Finally, more &amp; more people who have actually read the books are telling the truth about this show: Which is, that this adaption is NOT a faithful adaption of the books and it was never going to be (contrary to the lies that the producers have been telling everyone). <br>The games were far more faithful to the books than this show is. They&#39;re also the far superior visual adaption.<br>If anyone is going to rage and start calling you bad names over this video then they&#39;re just another of the many liars and ignorant SJW trolls all over the internet who literally go out of their way to lie about and downplay legitimate criticism of this show (or anything that they dont to hear the truth about, really).
i havent read the books but i think im gonna now
Its a woke show created for showing female power rather then showing geralt and ciris story.
henry cavill is magnificent!!!!
Read the books a long time ago and thought a lot of stuff was rubbing me the wrong way but the show was gaslighting me a bit. Thanks for helping me remember the actual story. I think there are a lot of problems with the show, some of it is budget, some of it is trying to tell a story that the universe isn&#39;t telling. they arent telling the witcher story, they are telling their own using the structure of the witcher.
I need Fringilla to be recasted. Yen is.....ok i guess but Fringilla? Just why make her black? Why? As a black person I dont feel represented lmao just included but that doesnt matter for me in witcher nor does it do anything. Change Triss too. Please for the love of god. The actors, they know how to act but they dont fit the characters.
To be fair, Yennefer&#39;s and Ciri&#39;s backstories being changed from the book is a little hard to pinpoint for they&#39;re not explored in the book, only ever told. The books aren&#39;t perfect, they have their flaws. Sapkowski falls into this annoying habit of telling us a lot without ever really showing. You need to show your main characters, rather than tell us &quot;this is who they are, believe it&quot;. You can say the &quot;sky is green&quot; and it may appear to be such depending on who&#39;s looking at it. The lack of backstory explanation always bothered me, like a missing link in a chain, a loos thread on a blanket I just had to pull, but once it did, nothing unraveled and therefore nothing came of it. But, the lack of backstory for Yennefer, Ciri, Geralt, etc. allows for flexibility on the showrunner&#39;s part and they expounded on that.
A word from a friend:<br><br>NEVER EVER APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR OPINION<br><br>you made what could have been an insightful video about the differences in show and books to a whiny, circular, self referential apology to the comments.<br><br>I subscribe to hear your comments not your apologies.  And it is the internet !  <br><br>NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR OPINION
CD project writers are just much MUUUUCH BETTER<br>But to be honest it was better than I expected, geralt is on point but the series lacks a lot realism and small details
Imo @witchergeorge just formed his own opinion about the show and it wasnt just like he thought it would be.. So because you formed a opinion before you watched the series and it didn&#39;t line up with what the perception you had was you rated this negative.. And honestly thats a shame, you should have watched this series with a open mind.. It was very good and its a shame you rated it negative because of your own perception
Strong start then about episode 5 it just felt rush and more confusing. i lost interest but kept watching just to finish the series
I liked the show but also love hearing the criticism especially from fans who have read the books or played the games unlike those unprofessional so called critics in rotten tomatoes which is laughable, thanks for taking your time making a very good video which will only help improve the series hopefully if they hear you and other fans of the franchise
Hey man only thing  u r video  did was make me glad I didn&#39;t read the books first lol. And understand why the games took the approach they took in making the game  story-wise. But I still ur vid because I leaned more about to Witcher....so thanks
Honestly I both agree and disagree. I‚Äôm partly just happy we got a Witcher show but at the same time I want it to improve. However when you judge I think you are sticking WAY too close to the books. Don‚Äôt get me wrong their concept is my preference, but hey not everything is going to go our way. I say let‚Äôs take our time and enjoy what we can, give it a chance. I also you think you are saying that too much is unnecessary. For example, Geralt and his mum, I think it adds more depth to his past and character. However I agree with you when you say it is not the go to place to learn about the Witcher universe. I would recommend playing the games and reading a few of the books to new fans. Overall I think the show is good enough to keep us occupied and entertain at least some of us. I say it could have gone a lot worse and I see true potential.
The one thing i could not except is that in the opening seen Geralt dropped his sword,,,,, Really?????? a seasoned master swordsmen dropping his sword is utterly absurd.
Way to many downvotes, just insane.
I really liked to see the thoughts of someone who is very into the lore of The Witcher like you. Me instead only play the Wild Hunt and I actually loved the Netflix show LOL<br>I&#39;m now curious to see more of yours videos too!  You got a new sub bro...
You aren‚Äôt the only one that dislike it and you aren‚Äôt nitpicking. I feel the same. Please make that nitpick video.<br>Also please explain how magic works in the witcher universe.
If you think of it as a completely separate thing from the books/games you grew so attached to, and think of it as a...oh, an alternate universe? Like, how star trek would have lots of occasions where they&#39;d have have some bullshit anomaly and we see their alternative selves that were formed by just a slight tweak in the situations and they&#39;d still be the same yet...slightly off? I view it like that. I view the books and the games the same way too, where the games are an alternative universe continuation of the books. <br><br><br>It is VERY difficult to start to love anything new dealing with the characters and world you&#39;ve grown so attached too. I imagine that this is how people who read the books well before the games felt when they came out. It&#39;s not at all a bad thing, just human. It may take time to learn to like the Netflix series purely as it&#39;s own thing on it&#39;s own merits.
Every other scene has a random black actor in it completely out of place. They should have just got idris elba to play Geralt if they wanted to shit on European fantasy this much.
YES PLEASE, I WANT TO SEE A VERY NIT PICKY VIDEO FROM YOU.
I love what you had to say I agree but still very much so enjoy this series. And think this could be a great way to bring people to this world we love and are invested in.
Estoy bastante de acuerdo, realmente usar√≠a la palabra &quot;mediocre&quot; para describirlo, lo pintaron como la competencia de GOT y parece que no tuvo ni la mitad de presupuesto, pero bueno, siempre esta bien tener una adaptaci√≥n mas de una de mis sagas favoritas
I enjoyed the series but I am not that deeply into the lore. Glad to hear about the things they messed around with. I would like you to nitpick the things. I overall wish it was made by someone other than Hollywood. It keeps forcing the Hollywood culture into everything. Your book point is bullshit though. Stop being a bitch and read it.
Don&#39;t insinuate that people who are invested in the lore and books can&#39;t enjoy it lol. Lots of people who read the books enjoyed it a lot. Like I get why you don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s different? But it being different doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad or unenjoyable. If anything it&#39;s refreshing.
It is good to hear thoughtful criticisms and I&#39;ve only just started Reading The Last Wish. (Really enjoying it so far)<br><br>Just wanted to say I am enjoying the show, and the games are what got me interested.<br><br>I think changes are necessary and actually enjoyed what they&#39;ve begun and can only hope it gets better from there.<br><br>Still good to hear a different opinion and hope that Lauren is listening and ready to continue helming the project. I think it&#39;s silly to expect love from everyone but can only hope they improve.
Yes, please do make a nit-picky review!
Just because it&#39;s &quot;Different&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily make it bad? You point out a lot of differences which is all fine, but so what? Like yeah we never had all those Yennefer scenes before, but that doesn&#39;t really make it bad, the Yen stuff are pretty good imho.
I dont understand why so many people do not understand the virture of balance. Too much positivety is not as great as assumed and too much negativity is equally as imperative. Each without the other takes away the genuine essense of what makes life interesting.
I had just got done reading The last wish and other than the dobbleganger charcter and the way magic works I could have sworn this was an exact copy of the book
I totally understand that if you want to see a faithful adaptation from the novels to the new series, then you will be severely disappointed. As a fan of many comic book and fantasy series, I learned long ago TV and movie adaptations are not meant for those that read the source material. It&#39;s meant for the mass audience. I&#39;m more interested if they capture the essence of the source material and for me, I feel that they have captured the essence of the novels. This new Witcher series has accomplished that for me.
I feel like they HAD to age up Ciri, same reason as why Game of Thrones aged up many characters like Jon, Danny, Arya, etc...a lot of fucked up shit happens to Ciri, casting a child would be a bit iffy in multiple ways.
Dosent geralt have two swords <br>One for human<br>One for monsters
Lol I‚Äôve read the books through twice and played the shot out of the games. I loved the show. You can‚Äôt compare it to the books, just see it as it‚Äôs own thing and it‚Äôs pretty damn good.
There are plenty of people that have read the books, know the lore, and still like the show for what it is in its own canon
Just wanted to see what people were talking about it. It was great it went exactly by the first book. Word for word scene for scene.
They wanted to introduce Ciri and yen early. They wanted to tell it all from a different perspective. Books are outstanding but I see it as a new adventure and another point of view. I loved seeing how yen became who she was. It was genius.
When I saw Vilgefortz I was dumbfounded
Contact Henry Cavill somehow. He seems to genuinely love the game, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;d appreciate your feedback
the movie was ok to watch only once, but it missed the point. no connection to the characters or the world. The game showed a true atmosphere of slavic legends and universe.
I get what you‚Äôre saying bro but why not just judge the show as it‚Äôs own standalone piece of entertainment. Stop comparing everything to the books or the game and perhaps you‚Äôll be able to enjoy it. They created their own version of the Witcher. They weren‚Äôt setting out to replicate the books. So In that regard they achieved what they wanted and without comparing the show to anything it is fantastic.
Good vid, I played and read the material. I liked the show, anything witcher is good to me. It could be better, but it&#39;s fine.
As a book reader, I enjoyed the series. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm gonna say.
I think the omission of a lot of the short stories and the simplification of the plots included really ruin the world building. Because of this it doesn‚Äôt feel like the Witcher to me, the world just felt shallow and small.
I loved it. I will be so pissed if they cancel this series.
I started out with the games so i have no clue how it were in the books tbh and cannot compare it. I will say that show is an intro for those that have not read or played the games.
Holy fuck I&quot;m so tired of whiny ass people. Make your own show then. Thumbs down
you literally say we should judge the show for the show but your whole review was based on how its not like the book wtf
Honestly after listening to this review and thinking about it, I gave this show way too much credit. I never read the books and I‚Äôve only played one of the games so I‚Äôm definitely not an expert on The Witcher. I will say I hated the Yennefer storyline. Maybe I was just excited to see Henry Cavill as Geralt, I don‚Äôt know. Also I might just be dumb but the world of The Witcher just seems a little over complicated. I can understand Middle-Earth and Westeros fine but I think I need to do a bit more research into the world of The Witcher. I‚Äôm also glad that you make it clear that this is more of an adaptation than it is a retelling of the books because I was beginning to take this show at face value with the lore and characters presented to us.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=7m35s"">7:35</a> YES YES. Removing the brokilon forest gave Geralt no connection to ciri and made his sudden change to accept his destiny feel weak and ruined Geralt arc
Sucks to have the viewpoint that you have... Good thing I haven&#39;t lived and breathed The Witcher for the past 2yrs... so I can just sit back and enjoy it
Honestly,  thanks for being honest.  That is why I liked your videos (before the show).  Thanks for your honest opinion. I&#39;ll keep watching your videos.  ....
good points and i thank you for bringing them to light, but too much time went into defending your review and tip toeing around fragile viewers, those who cannot handle different opinions should just go elsewhere or grow up
I thought the show was pretty good, but season one suffers from the short story format of the first 2 books and also only 8 episodes.
As someone who only has played The Witcher 3 and I plan to start reading The Last Wish soon, I really enjoyed the show.  The scenes between Geralt and Dandelion were some of my favorite. My main gripe I hope is addressed for next season though is Triss&#39;s actor as she is so far off from the actual character that I don&#39;t know how she got the part. Other than that, I am looking forward to the next season.
I love this show.<br>Change my mind?
I don&#39;t think he(Geralt) said, &quot;fuck&quot; enough. LOL
Cahir is a god now i guess what do you mean how does this lil boi beat Vilgefortz when he literally broke Geralt&#39;s soul i mean my man was limping in 2 books after their first encounter and it took the combined efforts of geralt, yen and regis to take him down, and let&#39;s not forget that Vilge boy melted regis like he was nothing and geralt ONLY won because of the amulet he got from FrInGiLa like boi fringila can suck my left toe. Just hope they fix Cahir cause baptism of fire is ruined otherwise
I did enjoy the show. Far from perfect, but still fun. But if someone asked me &quot;should I read the books or watch the show?&quot; I&#39;ll say 100% of the times read the books.
Triss&#39;s cast is such a disappointment
i really like it ,the guy that played supermanHenry Cavill really great and Anya chalotra and rest of cast great
I like that people think that adaptations should be exactly as the original source. Is not. Not even the games are. They expand and adapt the story to their media. They have to take their own paths. The true and only true witcher story is the one in the books. This helped me enjoy the show even more. Netflix knows this is a very good source, they need to invest more and expand. Love it.
I liked the show. I totally didn&#39;t realize ciri and geralts stories where different time lines till episode 4.
A game developer company made the witcher great which was just good. To make something which is already gold into a trash that shows you don&#39;t have any talents just pure arrogance and ignorance. This is a epidemic right now in Hollywood film industry.
I‚Äôll be honest I loved the first season of it I liked that yen had a lot of detail about her (although not all that accurate) it makes a viewer have more of a connection with her and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs just what they were going for I also loved all fight scenes as well as dandelion and Geralt I agree not everything is perfect and even just from playing the game as well as watching a lot of your videos ( there great btw) I understand not everything id accurate and a fair few things are quite predictable for people with general knowledge of the Witcher however I do really love this and I hope season 2 is more enjoyable keep up the vids and hard work your doing a great job
It&#39;s good. I really enjoyed it, I mean it&#39;s more witcher content. It had it&#39;s parts which annoyed me but I just went into it with the mindset that it&#39;s not cannon at all and the lore is probably gonna be dumbed down for a new casual audience. Tbh though was far better than I expected and I&#39;m really looking forward to season 2.
The Witcher books and games have been a huge part of my life. I think the series is ok, but it‚Äôs hard to ignore certain changes as you mentioned in your video. I think Anya Chalhotra does a pretty good Yennefer (apart from the obvious deviations from the books). Not too convinced with some other casting, especially Eist Tuirseach (doesn‚Äôt seem very ‚Äòskellege‚Äô to me). The Nilfgaardian armour could‚Äôve been modeled better, honestly looks pretty cheap and plasticy. Costuming was too early in our world parallels (i.e. it‚Äôs more 16-17th century inspired, rather than 12-14th century‚Äôs, which the games largely used as a basis). Otherwise, I don‚Äôt mind the series, I just hope season 2 is better.
I never read the books or play the games. Loved this show so far
Its all up to interpretation
I wish Netflix hired you or someone like you.
all the girls I talked to said pretty much the same thing &quot;the only thing they liked a lot was the yennefer storyline&quot; .. there you go .. they need to appeal to everybody .. so I agree with what they did even though I didnt like it myself ..
So how come the hedgehog guy got a wife while Wicker guy got a daughter?
Well it&#39;s an adaptation after all, you didn&#39;t expect them to do everything like the book did you lol
Thank you so much for this. I thought I was being insane and forgetting stuff from the book and went back and reread the first two and was like ‚Äúno, this is definitely wrong.‚Äù Now that I‚Äôm watching this, I can see it‚Äôs upsetting to others. I thought the whole Brokilon event was complete BS as well as the escape from cintra.<br><br>Edit:<br>It‚Äôs as if the writer for the show read spark notes of the book and decided to then play a game of telephone with the whole script and cast.
You are spot on!!!
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH U, they completely screwed up the sword of destiny and something more stories. thats like an unforgivable change, it completely undermines the emotional impact of the reunion at the end
I read the books, played the games. Feel the same way as you. Great review!
I hate what they did with the show.<br>1 they got the wolf pendant wrong <br>2 Gerald had two swords <br>3 no black people in the whitcher games <br>4 frangila was not black <br>5 ciri was not a blonde <br>6 yeneffer was not an ugly hunchback troll bitch.<br>7 fucked up triss too
Good for you that you said your real opinion. I disagree though. Is not &quot;bad&quot;. Its Awful. The sooner the show dies the better. Or what could be even better is that they fire Hissrich. <br><br><br>Other than that, i agree with everything you said.
Funnily enough, the first episode was the best one. The actress that played Renfri should‚Äôve been Triss. It seems like the budget ran out by the end of the season because that mage battle in ep.8 was laughable. Fringilla was a terrible casting choice and it almost seemed like they‚Äôre trying to market the whole brotherhood/ sorceress half of the show as a cheesy teen gossip girl type deal. Bleh <br>6.5/10
As I haven&#39;t read the books myself i can&#39;t really make a decent argument against this however I feel like if you where to look at this show from a persons point of view who hasn&#39;t read the books its good. It explained all the points it did so new people to the franchise wouldn&#39;t feel too out of the loop. But yeah as someone like yourself it would feel like a kick in the teeth. As it is a TV series I can understand why they needed to have 3 different story arcs as this allows the world to be explored more for the new viewer to see the amazing world the witcher has created but to choose yen as the third was wrong I&#39;ve always seen Yen as this mysterious character, she shouldn&#39;t of been a main character, in the show she just seemed like a stuck up bitch with a bad past lol. So I have to agree maybe they could of toned down Yen&#39;s arc to show more about Geralt and Ciri as that is whats important. <br><br><br>All in all though I really enjoyed it and I am just glad Henry Cavill played Geralt well, I was really worried but he surprised me and I couldn&#39;t be happier he got the role honestly.
The show runners knew exactly what they were getting into when they took on this show. The bar is set very high for the Witcher from both the books and games. Yes, the games we&#39;re not perfect, there are some plot holes but damnit, CDPR got it pretty close to perfect and made the whole universe of The Witcher come to life. Sapkowski doesn&#39;t want to believe it but the games are the whole reason why it became an international success. We also have to remember the games would&#39;ve never happened if it wasn&#39;t for the books. I honestly believe the show needs to pull the style from the games while telling the story from the books.  <br><br>In the books, we felt the emotions that these characters are going through as if they were real people. It&#39;s masterful storytelling. The show feels rushed and I honestly believe the show runner just skimmed through the books. With that, I believe there is not enough intimacy with the show to make a stellar adaptation. Even their own unnecessary filler, creativity and add on to the Witcher universe/lore is lackluster at best. If you remember, the show runner kept preaching she was going heavily go with the source material. Then book readers see the show and realize they&#39;re changing a lot of those small details that made The Witcher franchise what it is in the first place. In otherwords, if you say you&#39;re going with the source material, go with it. The source material was already great and didn&#39;t need any changing or fixing. <br><br>The reason why hardcore Witcher fans are nitpicking is because there is a connection the author and the games made with the audience. That connection is amazing when you fully get into it. We want that level of storytelling and connection with the Netflix series and the show runners are not hitting that mark just yet. The books and games have a very high standard to reach. The show runners need to know that they also need to reach that level to be fully successful. In other words, we know they can do better and hopefully they will.
I never had a problem with      show/movie adaptations.  If the show was too similar to the book I have a lot less of a reason to watch the show. I would be watching a live action version of stuff i already know.
I dont know if it&#39;s the right description, but Yennefer felt...dumbed down. In the books and game she comes across as mysterious, powerful,  and almost in a scary way, has a lot of knowledge and is confident and competent but is also a bit of a closed book. I like that about her! In this show she only had the beauty but lacked the confidence and it&#39;s a real shame. I also think the whole past as a hunchback thing was unnecessary. It didn&#39;t make her very mysterious at all.
Big fan of the witcher universe I can see the changes and didnt really like this season but i can 100% see the potential i really hope they develop the story with ciri and Gerald
Nilfgaard armor looking like ball sacks....
If you are personally offended that someone doesn&#39;t like that thing you like then your locus of personality is not in your mind.   Run, don&#39;t walk, to a psychologist.  You need fixing.
Well this sucks. I was really hoping this would be accurate to the books. Personally I liked the show and the fact that there&#39;s a fan playing the lead role.
Yennifer and triss need to be recast before season 2.  They need to focus on geralt WAY more
What I&#39;m confused about, in the show Ciri&#39;s father is a randomer.  In the game, Ciri&#39;s father is Emhyr.  Why?  Who was Ciri&#39;s father in the books?
So they are just doing their own witcher like the game did.
binged watched it....lovved it. can&#39;&#39;t wait for seassonn 2
Im a witcher gamer. Never read the books. I found out about some stories from the books afterwards. For me, this show is not perfect but i love the witcher and even if they changed alot, im just happy to see this show coming to life. I do understand why u are disappointed. Im sorry bro i wish u could enjoy it as much as i have.
BS interpretation of great books.<br>1/10<br>Besides the comparison, this show is bad on its own. boring and without any emotion.
I&#39;ve only played Wild Hunt and thought the show was quite enjoyable but still had a lot of weird stuff. Like Nilfgaard being portrayed as a weak empire initially, and then showing it as an evil empire... I feel like a very important theme in the Witcher is that there is not one group of good guys and another of bad guys, there&#39;s just terrible people everywhere or maybe they even have good motives. I also agree that Cahir beating Vilgefortz makes no sense at all and the dragon episode was very weird, among other things. I&#39;d say the two first episodes where the best. It makes me sad to find out that this adaptation wasn&#39;t faithful to the source material because I looked forward to knowing the full story from the books.
100% agree had to stop watching after ep 5, all the changes were so unnecessary and jarring it just irritated me.
Cavill nailed the role, that man either read the books,  played the game,  hung out with CDPR or all the above  BUT  yennefer, fringilla and triss make me cringe in this tv adaptation especially yennefer!!
Hi, I really appreciate your opinion and I agree with most of it.<br>I have not read the books (I will) but i&#39;ve watched alot of lore and books videos including your videos and i&#39;ve played the games about 20 times XD.<br>Opinion:<br>- I don&#39;t like how antagonistic nilfgaard is and how they seem to be &#39;&#39;Evil&#39;&#39;, they are an &#39;&#39;Invading&#39;&#39; force so I can understand how characters may see them as such but, their actions seem to be focused on evil acts and I don&#39;t like it.<br>-I feel like Henry Cavil did a good job with playing Geralt, not perfect but really good imo.<br>- I do not like Ciri&#39;s character at this point in time because I feel like they didn&#39;t develop her character at all.<br>- I don&#39;t &#39;&#39;hate&#39;&#39; Yennifer&#39;s character and I didn&#39;t mind most of her scenes except pretty much everything in Aretuza, but I didn&#39;t mind her development because it makes her seem more like a grounded character that developed into this world and didn&#39;t just popped out of thin air. (I say this because she needed to appear at this place in time for THIS version of this story)<br>-I did not like Foltest&#39;s character...that&#39;s all i&#39;ll say XD.<br>- The flashback of Geralt and his mom was useless imo.<br>I believe that if you only played the games and never seen anything about the books and the lore you would love this show, I don&#39;t personally &#39;&#39;Love&#39;&#39; it but I did enjoy it. Do I think it could of been better---&gt;OMG YES, but it was entertaining enough for me to say i&#39;ll watch season 2. I&#39;d like to say that with all shows that are adapted from books, it is unfortunate but as a book reader I always go in watching a show/movie/etc knowing that some scenes will be partially or completely redacted from the show, I hate it just as much as everyone though.<br>Thanks if you read all of this :D, love your videos.
Really complaining about the battle of sodden Hill...
Mr George Sir, I agree with you 100% in this video as I also have read all books and played all games and the badly written new additions to the show are awful and the rushed and jarring pacing plus the non linear format between different timelines is done so badly. Sure some elements and core plot threads were there from the short stories but many characters were handled badly especially Yennefer being so awful when she&#39;s awesome in the books. I had this experience with GOT because I have read those and the writers seem to conjure up tripe and add it to the lore and it doesnt fit and makes it less so whereas everything CDPR has added has fit and works. I would actually like to see a full breakdown video of season 1 maybe focusing either on the short stories giving us all the details (I read Last Wish when witcher 1 came out i cant remember all) and comparing it to the barebones and messy version of the show. I don&#39;t know why people have been hating on you man I just subscribed to you because of this video and ive watched many of your other lore videos and think you make awesome content with good explanation/research as well as your own opinions because the witcher can often be morally subjective of course. Keep up the good work man!
Is it bad I would LIKE a nitpicky video? I mean I have SOOO many nitpicks I want to almost make my own video.
They changed the law of magic and it is so WRONG!!! <br>If you change it the witcher world would be never the same. It is just like gravity to our world.<br>And ain&#39;t mages sterile due to using magic?? Then why no mage who needn&#39;t magic transformation in the show has her own child? <br>Changing the rule will make everything unexplainable. This&#39;s what I mostly disagree about this show.
I&#39;m still hyped for season 2. Mostly to see geralt use Igni to burn some bandits
The golden dragon was my favorite short story in the book and it‚Äôs the one they butcher the most. Cahir was also my favorite geralt companion and he‚Äôs being treated like a evil cultist
Is it why I found the Battle of Sodden Hill boring for some reason?... Cuz throughout the whole thing I was thinking &quot;Dude, is this thing not over yet? Can we get to Geralt and Ciri&quot;.... in some ways I found the fights entertaining but most of it just takes too long <b>IMO</b>
I really believe that they are going to add alot in this second season 2. I think the first couple of seasons can just focus on setting up the story. And I think they read the books. Yeah they took creative liberties. and that probably took away a bit. This season could&#39;ve been 10 episodes so those last 2 episodes could not be rushed as well as keep things more together...idk what they are going to show in this second season but they have alot of material to work through from the books that if done right can make for a classic. I dont mind people taking creative liberties but dont make them willy nilly. The author of the book I dont think hated this series and I think they can improve on the second season.
and by the way witchergeorge i also have witcher in my name too. i love this world and lore
hey i understand you. i agree/disagree. the show is good but from lore standing no. i prefer books and games more. i am also a lore buff too witchergeorge. you r right they totally changed things around and added things and i ask myself why did they do it that way. i find the show to be separate from books and games they messed it up but i am willing to like it but to me it is really not witcher for me either good show just keep it separate from books and games that is how i will like it.
Great video! Personally i loved the show. Im starting to read the books and i love the games and honestly as a witcher fan im just happy its getting the popularity it deserves. Seeing it adapted in live action means a lot to me. Although i agree theres a lot of things they dont get right, im just happy to see one of my favorite properties succeed and seeing new people enjoy something ive loved for years. Seeing how much Henry loves Geralt and how hard he worked to bring him to life although not perfect, is admirable and i can see how much he loves the property just as much as us. Honestly the show felt like it had a lot of heart, i know its difficult making a show not only for fans but for audiences who never even heard of the witcher so i never expected an exact representation. I just loved how for me ‚Äúmy opinion ‚Äú they stayed true to the essence of the characters. I loved the music, the cinematography, the fight scenes. I do believe it could have benefited from 10-12 episodes instead of 8, just because theres so much story. I wanted them to flesh out Geralt and Yennifers relationship. Their constant back and forth is eluded to but itsnt deeply explained. That couldve used more time. I think ciri shouldve met Geralt earlier, maybe episode 6. They kinda stretched out her storyline and they couldve cut some things and spent time on their relationship. Other than that i really liked the show,  im excited for season two.
I really enjoyed but I do agree about how magic and nilfgaurd but i feel the whole yennefer thing is necessary for other people
2 episodes down and I‚Äôm confused as hell....üòí
To many diverse people. Thats my only problem. Stick to the books and European folklore. If im not mistaken, i think everyone is supposed to be white like the games but I could be wrong. Its been a while. People will hate me for this comment but i feel like it has to be said because i am a total book person and i think everything should be spot on to the authors writings.
Keep telling it how it is don&#39;t listen to the negative comments dude
MAKE THE NIT PICK PLZ!!!!!!!!
This wasn&#39;t a critique, it was a spot the difference between the show and the books
I personally enjoyed the series. I have a few issues but I don&#39;t know any lore from the games or books. I&#39;m an avid fan of fantasy and have been interested in the Witcher for some time though. I can understand a fan having issues, I&#39;ve had similar problems with adaptations of properties I enjoy. I just think the way to approach any adaptation is with an open mind and an understanding that things will be different and you may not like them. Just try to enjoy it as it&#39;s own thing. That just my 2 cents though.
Completely agree. Was really cool to see the things they got right, those are 10/10 for me. But with how much they changed from the source material, that I was looking forward to seeing, left me extremely disappointed. At least now I know what I should expect of season 2, maybe I will enjoy it more because of that.
I understand where your getting at, personally for me though. I have both read the books and have played through both the second and third games and yet I still feel its a true adaptation. I personally just felt that they twisted and turned it to make it work better in a way for TV, even then though yes it was still confusing at times to follow what was going on and it did help that i read the books to give me a clearer idea what was happening. I like the changes though! It made and still makes me excited to watch it and wait for the next season (hopefully seasons!); and i think i was saved from disappointment by the pure fact that i never really expected it to be a true to life, copy and paste, adaptation of the books. Nothing that comes from TV or movies is! lol. I remember hearing a quote from the author and I&#39;ve kept it in my mind while both playing the games and approaching this show, &quot;The book is the book and adaptation is adaptation&quot;.
As someone who  knew nothing about the story, I did not see evil portrayed on either side.  What I saw was people in power on both sides smearing the other side to advance their goals.  I never felt any of the show weasel trying good vs evil.  It‚Äôs more us vs them or playing on human fears of the unknown.
As someone who loved the show (huge witcher fan here, read all the books and played the games) I really appreciate how you approached his video. Great observations .. if you end up making more videos on the show I would love to see comparison videos!.. ex: fringillas story line, cahir, etc
Gawd. Bit sad this is getting internet bile.<br> Just finished watching it. Thought it was great to be honest. Great atmosphere. Story, characters.<br>It&#39;s never gonna be the book or games guys. I admit I&#39;ve not read them or played the games. But I think they have clearly put alot of love into this one.<br> Truly looking forward to where they go with it.<br> Sure the armour was in the cheap side an looked crap. Only real issue I had with it. But grew up watching Hawk the slayer with silly string spells. I mean, for me I can for give a few FX fails an budget consetions if the story/characters are decent. I can let it slide.<br> Cavil did a great job. An no performances were terrible.<br> This is the kind of brave thing I&#39;d like to see from Netflix. <br> For a computer game adaptation I feel like it&#39;s pretty decent.<br> One of best things on Netflix at the moment I would say.
What a perfect way to express an opinion and what a perfect review, when u said click off i didn&#39;t listen to u although i lived the series. The difference between me and u is just as u said, ur involved a lot in this universe, that&#39;s not my case i just enjoyed the game i loved it&#39;s the best game ever and i just wanted more so it was a right time for a series that&#39;s why i loved it and ofc i loved the swordplay etc... Anyway this review is great.
Lets be honest, they couldve copied everything from books but what show would that be. I liked how they changed things.
I agree with what you dislike about the show although I do think this 1st season was pretty much just a setup for different storylines.
new sub.. peace n love brother. i like the video
I love this show on netflix
I largely agree, but it should also be pointed out that the games change a lot too. (See emhyr)
I think you‚Äôre being really nit picky here man. There‚Äôs a lot of details you mentioned which really aren‚Äôt necessary just the same as all that yennefer crap which I agree with you. But if I had to choose between one or the other. I‚Äôd rather have more dialogue and depth with yennefer than all these other little things that were changed. I do agree with you about vilgefortz though and cahir. But it seems they‚Äôre simply taking a different direction which I am very interested to see in season 2. The main thing I‚Äôm glad they got right was geralt and jaskier. I thought these carried the show especially geralt. In my opinion Henry Cavill performed perfectly or is there best geralt we would ever hope to see. He totally understands and embodies geralt and has a mix from both the games and the books which I love.
i am positively surprised! it&#39;s not perfect but quite good.<br>i dont really get the timeline critique - it makes totally sense and is not too complicated... my only critique is the lack of world building. they get the atmosphere pretty good but the locations are very isolated, e.g. aretuza or temeria/wyzima, which is poorly designed (it should be a big city &amp; kingdom...) and the viewer doesnt have an idea of the geography as there is only one scene with a map. it would not have taken much to improve that...<br>also i dont get the critique for nilfgaard ... you take the sayings of the northern kingdoms as &quot;facts&quot; - thats not only naive, thats surprinsingly stupid to be honest.. it&#39;s a one sided view we get &amp; that&#39;s pretty obvious...
I only know the game, but the show really really handicapped mages in that last battle and in general needing to give something for the magic they perform. Also they couldn‚Äôt use all the plants around them? Felt like that was really lame.
it&#39;s netflix,HBO or Amazon could have done better job...
I enjoyed the show but I also totally understand and appreciate your perspective here. I‚Äôm a massive fan of the Witcher game but I‚Äôve never read the books, so I already went into this expecting it to be different from what I‚Äôve become accustomed to. My issues stem more from CGI, costume designs, set locations, set pieces, use of magic and use of signs. Anyone calling you names and getting upset for your opinion that‚Äôs not at all offensive - they‚Äôre breading you, brov! Great video! Love your channel and appreciate all your hard work.
I never read the books but I thought Yennifer&#39;s backstory was one of the strongest parts of the show.
You convinced me by pointing out all these points that I should read the books dont know why I havent started before because I played all 3 games when I discovered the witcher 2 back in the day
I respect your opinion and you have great points, although im not nearly as big a fan as you are but its a tv show and that means they need to have drama and in turn over dramatize things to appeal to the viewer.
It isn&#39;t an objectively bad series (bar Niflgaardian armour, that&#39;s shit). It&#39;s just a bad WITCHER series. I still think it&#39;s unfortunate as I thought it would bring my imagination of the books to life and reinforce my imagination of the Witcher universe. But it doesn&#39;t deserve to get shit on.<br>Solid 7/10 series
I too had a few complaints with Yenefer and Nilfgaard. However, I did love Dandelion and Geralt, they were great. The actress for Yenefer was good, I dont like her story as much. I loved the design of monsters in the show, I really did. The setting was spot on for me. Cahir was a great character in the books but they portrayed him as evil in this show. <br><br>So all in all, I will keep watching the series. I like it, even if some of it was changed. But then again, so were things in the games changed yet I still liked it. Also, I love your channel
I&#39;ve read the books, played the games, and I knew this was going to be its own thing. I don&#39;t think saying &quot;I read the books&quot; is the reason to feel justified in you disappointed. Of course, feel as you do or will, but we&#39;ve been warned countless times.<br><br>I didn&#39;t want the show to resemble the books 100%. However, I agree with your points about Nilfgardians being zealots and Cahir being able to overcome Vilgefortz. As for Yenn&#39;s arc, as a reader, I detested Yennifer until I was well into the saga. So this gives viewers a chance to not simply  conclude she&#39;s just a total... yeah. This show had a lot of folks and PR going against it, and thus I feel they needed to make sure they made us feel for each character. I agree, again, that there were characters that could have been handled better. <br><br>As an avid fan of the books and games, this season made me very happy, and leaves plenty for people to discover in the books and games. I think they did what they could with setting the scene for the plot for Blood of Elves and beyond. Remaking a movie btw is hardly an apt example of adapting books into a movie or TV series. No anger, just stating my view as a fellow admirer of the books for the past few years of my life.
In order to be able to think you have to risk being offensive.
Yeah, i&#39;ve never read the books and even i felt that some things were off,<br>But it&#39;s the same thing with 90% of movie adaptations.<br>Just look at other books that got turned into movies, the movies have like their own different, but still kinda the same universe.<br>Still sad i cant read the books tho...
Dude, it doesn&#39;t have to be like the books, books are the base, the serie is an adaptation. So complaining about there is something different it&#39;s ridiculous
i stopped watching after you said you haven&#39;t read Lord of the Rings; you also said it&#39;s &quot;a book that big&quot;; lord of the rings it&#39;s quite a short trilogy; Wheel of Time on the other hand it&#39;s quite huge; I personally think the witcher books were quite boring and basic...
I see all the points you make I never read the books and only played the games and all your points were really good and you just really make me want to read the books so really thank you
I didnt read the books when i heard the show was going to be released for fear of what you experienced i personally enjoyed the show but the things that annoyed me were the way in which stories seemed to be occurring at the same time only for me to realise they werent and took me some time to figure out what was goin on. Also after watchin your video can see how scenes were changed and waffle added in for seemingly no reason. Saying this loved cavil as geralt.
The performances were great from the main cast but the writing let it down. Music was great however the budget felt limiting at times
I liked the show but I could still see the flaws in it, it‚Äôs not exact to the books but it‚Äôs still a fun watch, I saw it as they made it easier to watch for people new to The Witcher and make it easy to enjoy
For me it is a good show. It had somethings that could be better, but over all it&#39;s worth watching. Hope they pump it up in season 2 thought.. I say 7.5/10 score.
George thanks for the video! I pretty much agree with most of what you said. Most of the stuff with Yen I agree with I mean it could have been a quick thought/flashback to what she was and what she is now. As a guy of Polish decent I won&#39;t comment on much of the casting cause I know what that brings with it. I want to know why they picked such ugly(it&#39;s my opinion) women. I thought the big thing was sorceresses were suppose to be stunningly beautiful. They are not. Henry fuckin kills it as Geralt. Is he the most perfect nah but I think him being physically fit for his acting career and him being a super fan carries through. As a super fan of the books to this I know no matter what things change for whatever reason (not a film major so never know why). That said I&#39;d give the show 6/10 some stuff was done well. Geralt and jaskier are epic. The rest falls pretty short and my last comment will be about how the show editing was done. As someone who read the books couple times I was even lost in what timeline they were in. One minute it&#39;s the past and next it&#39;s &quot;present&quot; day. Not like anyone would listen to me, but as someone has dabbled in swordsmanship and studied armor. I&#39;d love to see commanders armor be more flashy so they stand out as opposed to the normal grunt. I get having so many low level soldiers you don&#39;t want them standing out but commanders should have more color and more elaborate dress. This is a good way to draw the eye to someone important. As for sword stuff most was pretty decent but for the love of God why do they do reverse grip sword fighting. That even at Witcher speeds will get you killed but ya know cool factor I guess. I am trying to remain optimistic that we will get to see decent casting for our other witchers; Lambert, ezkel, vesimir.
Yes, they changed a lot of stuff, but it&#39;s made to work better as a TV show. I&#39;ve really enjoyed the books so far and that experience won&#39;t worsen just because I&#39;ve seen the TV series that do things a little different. If anything it make everything feel fresh, you only must watch with an open mind but I understand not many people like stuff that&#39;s unfamiliar.<br><br>Like you I&#39;m just voicing my opinion and both arguments are valid, no need to apologise. We understand, you still bring some valid points.
Ha, odd, I actually think the yennifer stuff was actually pretty good (apart from the stuff when she fights with a sword lol like what) I personally think they should have stayed closer to the narrative structure of the books, and changed elements within this. There is nothing wrong with making changes and cool addition. The brokilon stuff was actually my least favourite stuff but my favourite story in the books. so that was sad for me. Dara felt like a strange replacer for geralt and it didnt work. I think the show should have have just focussed on the one book this season. SO if they really want to do the yennifer plot, they wouldnt have had to fit in the 3rd ciri one until the next season.
First video of you I watched, you seem like a really likeable person. I wanted to get in the witcher lore more but cound&#39;t bring myself to invest that much time in the books. Maybe I&#39;ll start with your video&#39;s :)
As someone whose read the books and played all the games, I love the Witcher as a series.  Now that I&#39;ve seen the Witcher tv adaption, I still love the Witcher.  I knew they were going to change things and honestly I was excited to see how they&#39;d change things.  It&#39;s a different version of something I&#39;ve read.  If what I&#39;ve read directly translated to the TV adaption then what&#39;s the point of the show?  I could just read the books.  I like this interesting take and I can&#39;t wait to see where it goes for Season 2.
They just need to get rid of the over the top moments then its greatp
I agree with you but I must wait to season 2 with make my opinion solid.  Some changes were unnessesery for sure some plot hard to make in film adaptation. Love Geralt, Jaskier and Ciri act. I must give them chance. I quite enjoy show.<br>Greetings from Poland.
I liked it. It was something new. And brought more exposure to an IP I love. If I can&#39;t cant have a new witcher game I&#39;ll take the show anyday.
I‚Äôve read the books and played the game. I love the show because it is a little different. I would be bored stiff if I knew what was going to happen at every turn. Why do you want an exact telling of the story? You‚Äôre getting new Witcher content that you can experience for the 1st time. Enjoy a new story instead of hurumphing over how it‚Äôs not exactly like all the stories you‚Äôve already read. How boring would that be?
Felt a bit rushed and almost as if they ran out of money after episode 3.<br>Netflix have fucked it.
i thought the show was fine as a fantasy show but not as a &quot;witcher&quot; show<br>though the &quot;Toss a Coin to Your Witcher&quot; song did get stuck in my head
I totally agree about all things you said about Yenn. Towards the end I just started skipping over her parts because doing so changed nothing about the plot. Honesty there wasn‚Äôt enough of Geralt especially towards the end of it.
Massive fan of the books and games, but....nah this show was fucking awesome, this is some of the best tv I‚Äôve watched for ages, a mature, excellent adaptation of the source material. Incredible writing, acting on point, every character nailed, amazing choreography, perfect pacing. Sets and cgi on point. <br><br>This is pretty much the perfect despiction of the ip for tv. No it‚Äôs not a perfectly accurate representation, but it should never be that, it‚Äôs it‚Äôs own product, with its own take, and it‚Äôs bloody brilliant.
hi, thanks for the video. It provides a nice alternate view and perspective then mine. I read about 30% of the books and played the game. I noticed that they changed quite a lot to the books and some of that also rubs me the wrong way. However, in general I like it quite a lot and will rewatch it with my family who do not know about the game or books. I am sorry that you dislike it as much.<br>I understand how being a lore specialist will make you very sensitive to the changes. <br>Maybe try to see the perspective of the writers. They have to implement this as a series. They have constraints (logistics, organisation, financial etc) and they have their own artistic and creative vision on how they want to present this.  <br>ty, Cheers
That was first really good review I‚Äôve seen. Finally I have something to send to my friends üôè<br>Still can‚Äôt wait for the second season. And seeing how they‚Äôll lead the whole huge story of the Sparrow.
Never read the books but I&#39;m huge fan of the the witcher 3 <br><br>I did enjoyed the show, to watch Geralt again it&#39;s just awesome<br><br>I hope season 2 going to better but so far, it&#39;s far from the games greatness
Thank you for the video.<br><br>I Read the books and played the games. The last couple of years I really got into the lore, characters and locations. It&#39;s my favorite story so far. And I&#39;m with you. You hit the nail on the head perfectly. I think after watching the show I&#39;m going to play the games again and read the books as well. They have more substance and are more interesting and captivating then the show ever will be. Don&#39;t apologize for telling the truth either! Especially something you are passionate about.
Cutting out Yen&#39;s back story would have given time to do the short stories properly. And time to cast the right actress.
Watched the eight in 1 thought it was good. Massivly impressed with Henry&#39;s portrayal
Congrats for your work and please don&#39;t apologize for being honest. Particularly i enjoyed the show, i didn&#39; t read the books so It makes mora palatable, however even not  reading the books its evident that Ciri&#39;s plot was in majority unecessary, i enjoyed Triss, Geralt and Dandellion a lot. Yen was great but adding so much origin to her dragged a bit and other interesting characters could have had more time if that was better balanced, the creatures were amazing, the only minor let down was Villentretenmerth in that regard, but he was still kinda cool. Something that really bothered me was that the witcher who was killed didn&#39;t seemed like a witcher, they didn&#39;t even gave him &quot;mutant&quot; contact lenses, only the black ones later on, and i still don,t understand why they chose to represent Foltest as a lazy seemingly fat old king since he&#39;s one of the greatest kings in the north. For me the balance was positive but there&#39;s a lot to improve and i hope to see that on season 2 when i will also have finished to read the books.
Well said, 100% agree. Here&#39;s hoping that they learn from their mistakes for season 2.
I don&#39;t know about anyone else but I loved the series!
Triss,ballsack amor, fringilla suck otherwise 9/10 love the witcher lore
Totally agree on Cahir and Villgefortz. Even if it‚Äôs imperfect I want more.
It‚Äôs like the lord of the rings movies, they were good movies but if you viewed the movies in comparison to the books and if you knew the lore they were not good. I do like the show though but I‚Äôve only played the games and read the first book
not gonna dislike but man you need to take a breather... 1 the author of the witcher liked the series.... wich fails to live up to your standards. 2 its an adaptation aka not a copy paste as artists do such things 3 with netflix witcher series, we have a witcher series, without we don&#39;t (duh) 4 henry cavill poured his soul into this thing and it shows. Arguable he is even better than the book/game geralt as its a combination of both. 5 ppl that don&#39;t know witcher universe &gt; ppl that do know it... yenifer story and ciri is a must as you need an audience. I will stop here, but sometimes to see the big picture we need to disconnect from the very thing we are trying to analyze.
Oh, finally someone saying it! I see everywhere that &quot;It&#39;s fantastic!&quot;, or &quot;The new GoT&quot;, ect... I just watched, and I was like: Whaaaat?! That&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to happen!<br>Seriously, what is this bullshit with driads shooting a male elf then making him drink the waters of Brokilon? They only shoot humans, and only give this special water to young girls to form them into driads as well! The same wtf moment was with the doppler assassin. Dopplers are basically kind creatures, and when they take a kind man&#39;s form, they become even more kind. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Sodden is also supposed to be a HUUUGE battle with armies, dozens of sorcerers and sorceresses, magic fireballs burning everywhere... Well, in the books it&#39;s not shown directly, but now that the showrunners decided to include the battle into the series, they could have made it grand. Instead, we got a simple siege.<br>I really hated Fringilla&#39;s character too. She is only introduced in the fourth book I think (maybe at the end of the third), and she has nothing to do with Emhyr taking back his throne.<br>And these are just some of the problems you didn&#39;t mentioned, there are also the ones you&#39;ve already said and I could continue it for hours. I really hope they won&#39;t screw up the rest of the seasons. In time I think I can accept if the short stories are changed, but the main story begins now, and it can do much harm to the series if producers change key elements of it (like they did when they left out the Geralt-Ciri scene in Brokilon).<br><br><br>And I really hope they change the actor and the song composer of Jaskier. They&#39;re both horrible.
I don‚Äôt think anyone should be upset or angry at you because you‚Äôre honest about your opinion. I very much value that in YouTubers and critics! Keep being you and doing your thing!
As someone who never read the books, and only played the games, my opinion is that the show is &quot;good&quot;.  Not fantastic, but definitely enjoyable.<br><br>I think the production values are very high, the direction was competent, but that the writing was a little on the weak side, specifically in certain episodes (like episode 4).  If they&#39;re looking to compete with the likes of Game of Thrones, they need to find better writers.  I especially didn&#39;t like how inconsequential Ciri&#39;s plotline was.  Her entire season can be summed up as &quot;Escaped Nilfgaardians -&gt; Found Geralt&quot;.  Didn&#39;t help that the final episode was basically Yennifer&#39;s show, so the meeting of Geralt and Ciri at the end had less impact than it should have.  <br><br>I&#39;m also not really a fan of them going for this triad of lead characters.  IMO they should have focused on Geralt.  But if anything Yennifer had more of a fleshed out story.  And considering her character isn&#39;t really that likeable for a good 2/3 of the season, that was a problem.  Perhaps she&#39;ll be better after Sodden. <br><br>As for the acting, I think it was really good.  Ciri, Triss and Yennifer met my expectations.  And I liked Cavill&#39;s interpretation of Geralt, even though it doesn&#39;t exactly match my idea of him. <br><br>Overall I think season 1 was a success and I look forward to season 2, especially if they can find some better writers.
Dude, it‚Äôs an adaptation. It‚Äôs not going to be portrayed like the books were written.
Wow i had the exact same opinions in my mind when i saw the show and i thought I was alone, i feel like reading the books ruins the show
It reminded me of Zena Warrior Princess. And btw ALL the costumes sucked. Looking forward to an improvement next season. I liked it ok. Have no knowledge of books n games. Nothing to compare it to except GOT n I can&#39;t compare them. It was okay. I&#39;ll keep watching if I&#39;m around.
Cutting out ciri and geralt&#39;s time in brokilon is just sad. The happiest and most joyful parts to read in the Witcher are the family moments. Wanting them to come together and be a family is the driving force of everything. <br><br>But instead we get Yen giving symbolic abortion speeches on a beach with a dead baby.
in the books.. in the bookS. in the booKS. in the boOKS. in thE BookS.  IN THE BOOKS. IN THE BOOKS. IN THEEE BOOOKS!<br><br><br>MY GOD STFU
Go off sis
The story to me was good enough and ibdont really mind the changes..but..those damn incoherent time jumps would really screw you over if you dont pay attention enough.. i think a simple transition edit or something would have greatly improved it but what do i know about making tv shows lol.. also as a fan of the books and the games, i would really have loved if they gave more emphasis on the medallion and the swords.. i mean no humming medallions and proper distinctions between the silver and steel swords.. i think there was even a scene where geralts sword on his back just changed from beeing a silver into steel (i could be wrong) but yeah simple details like those would have made me geek the hell out..
If only game of thrones was an exact adaptation of the books. Oh wait... Never mind. I like the show a lot. And it is a fine interpretation of the books. I respect that you may not like it as much as other but trust me that the cast, the feel and visual will never reach the ones you have imagined from the book. It&#39;s a fine show made by people that respect the franchise enough to not do a rise of skywalker.
I honestly find your complaining cathartic. Give me more complaining and nitpicking. I feel disappointed with the show too. But, they have the opportunity to tell the main story well and should get a bigger budget. The short stories were ruined, a shame.
Hi WitcherGeorge. I firstly wanted to thank you for all your video&#39;s you&#39;ve done on the Witcher universe. I&#39;ve learnt so much about the fascinating lore, and playing the Witcher 3 again has become even more enjoyable because of your videos. <br>I quite enjoyed the tv series, but I found the time jumping a bit jarring. My biggest disappoint though, was Triss. I don&#39;t think she was very well cast. Maybe because I really wanted her to be a red head. I also don&#39;t she had have enough on screen time to win me over. <br>Other than that, I&#39;m looking forward to what the next season will be like.
this is the best hate critic video i have seen i could hear some solid critic here and there. like 70% nitpick and 30% solid critics.
They are always extra critical of anything to do with video games. It&#39;s bullshit.
I always try to think of shows or movies based on books as like a parallel universe same people kind of a different story
Honestly I don‚Äôt like the actor who portrays Triss, she‚Äôs way too bland
I can understand the reasons why you feel the way you do but the fact of the matter is is that the show can‚Äôt follow EVERYTHING from the books because if they did each episode would have to be at least two hours long. They would need many more episodes to show every detail from the books. On another note though thank you for everything you do when I started playing the witcher I was SOOO confused on some of the lore and as I searched YouTube I found your channel and you really helped me out.
The games were amazing ...  They recreated the characters flawlessly ... And now we get this ‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢
The games also changed a lot of stuff about characters and lore. But when peoplee compare the games to the books they say: &quot;In the books it&#39;s like that but the games did it this way&quot; but when they now compare the show to the books they say: &quot;the show did it wrong, it should be like this&quot;.
Totally agree with you. Really want to like it and want it to succeed. I&#39;m trying to imagine how this series would be percepted from a person just being introduced to this world, compared to the understanding of someone whom has read the books. So many things I fell should have been done different. There is so much potential in the books dialogs, and I don&#39;t see any reason for not bringing it into the series. It dosn&#39;t need to be all action. Game of thrones early seasons proved that
All in all the show is great and really happy how it turned out it could of easily been another caravan of garbage they have represented the books well only altering minor and few things. I can see the 2nd season really picking it up
From someone who read the books, played the games but also liked the show - Thank you! I like the show, but it&#39;s an adaptation. They have indeed changed so many things. I would have prefered for them to be more faithful to the books. Sure, embelish whatever you can, take artistic licences, but don&#39;t change things. Or at least not to that extent. It has both annoyed and entertained me, as it felt unpredictable in that regard. It is obviously not following canon and I feel like I have to just take it separately.
I actually prefer that they did the backstory for Yennefer. I actually CARE about her unlike in the books or games where she was just some pretty lady who do magic and do angry. I really really don&#39;t like Yennefer in the books though so maybe I&#39;m partial to the Netflix series where I felt like she had other character traits besides her obsession with having a baby and being awful to geralt.
Game Of Thrones season 1 was 10/10. Witcher season 1 was so bad, i really dont find anything good about it apart Cavill as Geralt.
I loved the show, but It&#39;s always good to know the truth. I also have not played the games or read the books, but I&#39;m going to now. The only thing I know is some of your lore videos, which I like very much. Keep up the good work.
Even if you‚Äôre not a fan of the show if you plan on watching season 2 we can all agree that Vesemir is hype
Sort the flow of the narrative, no multiple timelines on the go, less CGI. The casting is excellent though, can&#39;t fault them.
as some1 who read the books multiple times i can tell u this -  the show is pure crap, if u want the real experience go read the books and dont wast time with this shit
Just going to see the video when I&#39;m finish with the show but I needed to come here to like the video :D
I have to say that I personally liked the show. I&#39;ve only played the games tho and only just watched lore videos, so my knowledge is limited in terms of the story in the books. I get why you and some ppl who have read the books might not like it. I&#39;ve watched several reviews of the show from people who are really into the lore and your criticism of the show just made me want to read the books even more :D So thank you for reviving my inner bookworm once again :P I know I&#39;ll be having a blast reading this series! <br><br><br>Also I want to see a video where you really go all in &quot;nitpicking&quot; :D Cheers and have a great Christmas!
I believe that your opinion on the show is completely valid. For me I thought the show was decent for it being an interpretation. Shoot the games themselves were an interpretation of the source material. But I see your points of where the show deviated pretty extremely.
hbo would have done a better job
Idk if it‚Äôs just me but I never played the games or books so I enjoyed it for what it is
I mean as a person who knows nothing about the lore and just started watching the show and knowing how i feel about what i like such as warhammer 40k and how i would feel if it was represented in that way i understand where your coming from and feel cheated in a way by the show and encouraged to read the books
I honestly loved it and need season two. Well guess I‚Äôm just gonna have to play the W3 again and be desperadoes till next year. I feel like it was fun and fresh
I didn&#39;t read the books. I agree Ciri is a bit old, and I wasn&#39;t fond of Yen. However, for all its changes I liked the show. You shouldn&#39;t however apologize for your opinion, I value your opinion as an expert on the real story and I hope you continue to review the show.<br><br><br>I feel the same about the Lord of the Rings movies, I am fully invested in the lore and the background. I liked them but wasn&#39;t thrilled with how they were presented. I am glad to see soo many people who do love them for just the movies.
It would be cool to see what you think Geralt looks like.
Man stop excusing . The fanboys are weak men. I am also a huge fan of the books and games and i agree that the show is okay at best. They did some weird things with the timeline and rushed things and the Brokilon passage was horrible.
As a fan of the books and games such as yourself, I&#39;m super invested in this universe. That being said, I understand your points but maybe the show just hit me different. I felt like Cavill absolutely nailed Geralt, in fact I loved all of the casting choices. Getting to see these stories from the books come to life was a pretty amazing time and I think they did a fantastic job. Obviously being a tv show they have to make some adjustments, not only just to be inclusive for newcomers to the universe but to also create new things even for people who have read the books. The CGI needs to be better, and the structure of the show should have been more clear, although I liked the pacing and rumors are suggesting season 1 was more of a test screening of the show and that season 2 will be much bigger. Not sure if anyone can relate, but watching this season was like watching Star Wars Episode 7 in theatres for the first time, it was magical, nothing gets me like this universe.
&quot;I hate being that guy&quot;<br><br>The comment section: <b>fine ill do it myself</b>
I also detected the changes, most notably not meeting up in brokilon....<br><br><br> However.<br><br><br>I think I can see where the showrunners had to make a choice and make those changes, due to the nature of how story construction must have happened for a TV adaptation.<br><br><br>The polish adaptation failed for this very exact reason. I think this show succeeded in overcoming that.<br><br><br>Nilfgaard being made evil?<br><br><br>A necessary evil of making a TV show like that. To speak in Game of Thrones terms, you needed some sort of &quot;evil&quot; side like Lannisters. Otherwise, without the massive exposition dumps ONLY possible on book medium, the audience will not be able to bond or interpret the story lynchpin characters.<br>Same with Cahir. We needed a looming evil to catapult Ciri&#39;s season long escape.<br>I liked this version of Borch better. It was more nuanced.<br>I actually liked a lot many characters better. I loved Renfri in this version.<br><br><br>I think it&#39;s a give and take. I loved a lot of things better than books, and some others I didnt.<br><br><br>Also, here&#39;s why I think this show will flourish.<br><br><br>The best. Fucking. Main character casting. Ever.<br><br><br>Even better than Stephen Amell as Arrow or Bryan Cranston as Walter White.<br><br><br>Pitch perfect main char casting that WILL carry the show on his shoulders if need be.
They changed so much, for absolutely no reason. I get that some changes had to be made, but it feels like they wanted to tell their own story instead of adapting the existing one.
Really enjoyed the show.
Take away their license and give it to anyone but a western corporation, they always either do a mediocre show or are infected with stupid social activists. A shame there are none eastern european corporations with enough money as to do. Great dissapointment. We will always have the books and games at least.
I loved the show but I see your point and respect you from your point a view. As a massive Spidee-Man fan I hated how the MCU made him a Tony Stark fanboy. Sure he always respected Tony in the comics but the movies made their relationship unbearable to me.
I&#39;ve only played the games and never read the books. However, I didn&#39;t like the show
The best way to watch this is to fast forward all of the pointless talking bits, speed through and drawn out pointless camera work, as none of this adds anything to the story. You can watch Season 1 in about 30 minutes by doing this and you haven‚Äôt missed anything, makes no difference at all to your enjoyment.
this isnt the witcher. This is the yennefer and ciri show
I do like it because after all is a witcher show... I love some of the things but hate most of the show. I hate netflix and their vulcanization of characters.
Ha it&#39;s game of thrones all over again. They did the same with GOT not sticking to the books with a lot of things and it seems like it the same with this show. I&#39;ve never read the books and seems like the only people that have a issues with the show is ones who read the books. I&#39;ve only played the games and maybe it&#39;s why i&#39;m enjoying the show so far and think it&#39;s great. Of course it does have flaws and some things are terrible but it&#39;s only the first season they have room for improvement if they do a second one.
Average bad fan fiction of &quot;the witcher&quot; for the most part. Plus a lot of other mistakes. Whats with american companies massivly changing original characters for the sake of diversity. Even without that, the music, the costumes, the lore disrespect and heavy alterations,lack of the main character and having an more than lore bases unbereable witch was what killed this show for me. Extra funny when the head &quot;writer&quot; said there would not be anything like that. A shame that if it turns put being good and people like it overall, by extension the people paying for the show will think all those other things are ok. Skipping over them is the minor form of protest I can find.
Hey just wanna say as someone who came into the show blind, you‚Äôre making a few assumptions on how blind watchers would understand things. I didn‚Äôt assume the south was a backwater, I assumed the North views the south as a backwater and therefore they must have a different culture. Basically how the reach in asoiaf view the North or the dornish. They‚Äôre different cultures there fore we‚Äôre superior and will make comments along those lines. Also didn‚Äôt get the impression that yennefer would screw up, just that there were people in the council that didn‚Äôt like her, so used that dislike to badmouth her. <br>I get your dislike, I‚Äôve worked in the asoiaf fandom for 13 years and despise the show. But just wanted to point out you‚Äôre assuming show watchers took all statements made at face value, rather than as spoken by characters who have their own motives for saying things.
Its decent. I am mildly peeved that they left out the main joke from The Last Wish. And that&#39;s about it really, minus pacing issues and mildly bad casting for some characters. <br><br>Henry did a good job though.
Who else was hella confused with the past and present setting of the show. I was very confused throughout.
I really enjoyed the series! But I also completely agree with your take on it.<br><br>Most of the changes from the books and additions were unnecessary. Then I remember this is an adaptation for tv so things have to be different. For instance, there kind of needs to a be a &quot;bad guy&quot; which Cahir and Nilfgaard are taking the roles of (although when SPOILER...the doppler acts as Ciri, I did feel like I saw a little change in Cahir). <br><br>The visuals and acting was spot on from most of the cast. Especially the last episode...really enjoyed the scenery. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;d give it a solid 8.5/10. I hope series 2 improves on series 1 and sticks a little closer to the books.
Very honest review mate. It‚Äôs good to hear someone with the same opinion as me, although I did enjoy it and was able to look past the inaccuracies. I do agree with all your points and at times whilst watching the show I was like ‚Äònah this ain‚Äôt right‚Äô haha!
Flaws are cool. Go for it.
It looks like a shite show, and I have no desire to watch it, despite being a huge tw3 / geralt fan
I found it unimaginative, slow, dull, and poorly made. I immediately compared it with the Game of Thrones series.. being both a medieval fantasy concept, and it was a pale comparison. Although the series had a good production, but nothing that separates it from other shows, to me the actors were indifferent, the characters disappointingly superficial and poorly developed, and many things were not explained. But then again, i am about to see now episode 4.. things might change, but so far, i, well. I cannot say i am disappointed, since from the trailers i did not expect much, thus, i got what i anticipated.. but what a waste.
WOW all I&#39;m seeing from the comments are incredible nitpicking.  First season, it&#39;s going to have the lowest budget it will ever have which fixes plenty of issues heading forward, like cgi, costumes, sets, etc.  I can&#39;t believe some of the things I am reading though, does everyone just expect a perfect adaption of the books translated to the screen???  This show is not being made for hardcore fans who know every single detail about the universe.  I&#39;m one of those people but I loved what I was seeing, expect for some changes here and there.  Changes are going to be made for the betterment of viewers who are brand new to the series and we have to deal with that.  The sword fighting is top notch, Henry is the perfect Geralt, Anya actually kills her role as Yennefer.  <br><br><br>TLDR; first season, lowest budget.  Costume director is being changed moving forward.  Main role actors are killing it.  We as fans have to deal with and accept changes to the story that are necessary for first timers.  Stop nitpicking bullshit and be thankful we have a live action show of the best universe in all of fantasy writing.  fuck
I have never read the books and I watched the trailer and decided to watch it. <br>First 45 minutes in<br>Costumes are very bad.<br>Acting is meh, Gerald doesn&#39;t have any depth , very monotonous and the queen actress is horrible.<br>CGI is sooo bad <br>Waste of time!!<br><br>If you want a serie to watch, go watch &quot;see&quot; .
I have read the books many times and played all the games as well. I kind of expected to hate the show, but i don&#39;t. It is mainly extremely boring, because all the subplots they made up serve little purpose or are ridiculous. The writing is definitely very bad, and even though the actors do their best, often what they say is so silly and disconnected to their character that it&#39;s comical.<br>Changing the stories in a bad way is a problem, although i didn&#39;t really mind. I never liked the show enough to care  about whatever they changed to be honest. Mainly, i switched between being bored by a scene, or laughing at Geralt&#39;s dialogue.<br>It&#39;s not a terrible show. It is simply below average<br><br><br>Some fight scenes were good i suppose, but they never came close to having the same impact as in the books. The buildup and surrounding characters were handled too poorly for the fights to be anything more than temporary relief from boredom.
I was Disappointed. But Henry Cavil and  Jaskier&#39;s actor nails it. Also aside from the books or any other witcher knowledge in someplaces the writer is super awkward and confusing the time jumping, the story changes etc
Dandelion and henry cavilles acting were the only things that i enjoyed the casting for the most part was terrible but those two did a decent enough job
&quot;Doesn&#39;t feel like The Witcher&quot; this defines the show...
I‚Äôve watched the first 2 episodes, and its what I expected apart from having to see a black face every 10 minutes. Why am I seeing Brazilian weave on my screen? I remember originally it was planned for Cirilla to be a black but guess they didn‚Äôt have the bollocks to do so. They should have done so to be fair. Turn Geralt into afro thunder, why not. Cant immerse myself in this comedy. Scorsese would never let that shit fly. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Please do a nitpick video.
I liked the show but I wouldnt say its a good adaptation of the books or games, its like marvel movies and comics where a lot of things are changed and dumbed down a bit
I respect your opinion however I think those changes are made so the majority of people watching the shows understands it more or its just easier from them. Not knowing the books and Witcher Netflix being a absolute copy of it would make it really hard to understand in so few episodes. The books are just too detailed and a lot of audience wouldn&#39;t understand the show
Please nit pick so that we can get a better insight as to what they should have done to make it more like the books
After seeing the overly activist beheavior of the director and the casting choices based on race bend of Triss and Fringilla, and to some extent Yen, I knew the show was going to be heavily affected by it.
Personally I really liked the Yennefer backstory that they did. The writing and the casting wasn‚Äôt great imo. The casting directors didn‚Äôt understand the character relationships well enough. How is yen going to be the mother figure of ciri when they look the same age. How are yen and triss friends when she looks old enough to be her mom ....<br>Geralts dialogue doesn‚Äôt sound like Geralt and in general the dialogue is written in a sort of juvenile way which isn‚Äôt fitting for a darker, gritty, morally grey world that the Witcher is. Overall I think they did a good job but perhaps the budget was lacking or there were time constraints.<br>I couldn‚Äôt agree more with what you mentioned about nilfgaard. They aren‚Äôt evil, and their use of magic was militarized but not any different than other magic use in the world. Nilfgaard is definitely not some backwater country. It‚Äôs called the Nilfgaardian Empire. EMPIRE. Personally I always got a very Roman or Persian empire feel from Nilfgaard. A conqueror empire which uses the conquered kingdoms for their auxiliary forces to conquer some more places. (Maybe it‚Äôs because I played a lot of Gwent where cards like ‚Äúslave infantry‚Äù were a staple nilfgaard thing)
My issues with it:<br>The time jumps are confusing unless you already know the story<br>Character development is missing chunks( unless you already know the story) <br>I think its decent the fight scenes are cool but this show was ment for fans and even as one, i didnt love it<br>Edit: The music also was a huge dissapointment. The games made me feel like i could fight a manticore naked with a stick while the show was barely noticeable
Just wanna see Geralt kill more monsters
As someone that is new to The Witcher universe and completely oblivious to the lore I thought the show was really cool despite it&#39;s inconsistencies and outright flaws. I loved the show but I was really annoyed how inconsistent the show was about magic, first you had to use a flower to lift a rock and then you can shoot a tsunami of fire with no cost. That being said if you are a fan of the canon you should see the show as a great way of introducing new fans to an awesome franchise. <br><br>The show has gotten me to buy the games and maybe the books too later if I can find them so I&#39;ll have some grinding to do lol
Yes this review is EXACTLY what i wanted(honesty), you mentioned POINT by POINT every thing i did not like, important stories and events are cut short and changed, especially Brokilon story event, and where is that super sweet girl Esi Daven, one of my favorite females from the books and in the Witcher world!! They better finish Sword of Destiny book properly in season 2 in first 4 5 episodes, or i gonna downvote and put as much as negative critique in this show, i swear!! :/
My main issue was with the casting choices of Yen, Triss and &quot;Fringilla&quot;, specially with the later. Such disrespect for the original work of somebody changed in such a massibe way to become a bad fan fiction social pushing agenda. I cant be the only one to not like that aspect. This is why I did not want an american company to take care of the show. They hire activists more than writers. Specially funny since the dirextor said nonr if that would happen. Plus the costumes and music could be way bettee.
I liked the show. I read the books and it was weird at first but I toght &quot;OK this is different but it is a TV show not the books (even tho they are based on the books) it is still a TV show&quot;
nitpicking
as someone who got into the games and books years ago and consumed it religiously for a long time i understand how you feel. i see vilgafortz or yennefer  and its just not what i see in my head (do not get me started on my fav character triss). anyways it kinda took a lot away from the experience for me as well but after i managed to accept it as an interpretation i was able to honestly enjoy it. i feel like the beauty of novels is that you get to create just as much as the writer. it also suggests that there could be no version of the show made that would satisfy my personal imagery of the books. i would say this though it is really nice to see something that i love get more and more discussion. it is not perfect by any means but i knew that from the beginning. hopefully you can enjoy it a bit as well.
I always appreciate everything you say. My experience has been that books are ALWAYS better than visual presentations due to our own minds controlling the narrative as you said.  I am one of the people that don&#39;t mind this adaptation but do see everything you mentioned as reasoning not to like it. I think that folks were team Yen too given the heavy focus on her. I don&#39;t think people realize the actress that played Triss is a model. She&#39;s very beautiful in real life.  Any way, you rule, keep being you and bringing your great reviews and play throughs!  I think it would be strange to be upset because someone has an opinion different than their own.  Anyhow, if you celebrate any of the holidays coming up I wish you and yours the best!
I was confused on the back and forth stuff. I liked it.
I like the series ( I have read the books and I agree there are many differences between the show and the books and although I enjoy the books a lot more I had fun seeing something new from the witcher)
I really dislike how they handled Aretuza and, more precisely, the students involved. Instead of what, like three of the girls that turn into eels, young Triss and Margarita should have been present to flesh out their characters and their relationship with Yenn and made that arc WAY more engaging.
I personally dont mind the changes and dont see it as incorrect compared to the books. Much like game of thrones there are similarities and differences and I understand a lot of the changes. I wish we had got ciri and geral together sooner and I didn&#39;t care much for yennifer&#39;s early life, but for the most part I think it&#39;s a entertaining and solid adaptation, if not the best re-creation it&#39;s different and I think it works well for a tv show as it has to be different to a book. I can see how it&#39;s hard to separate the two, but I try to see them as different mediums, each good in their own ways. I could have done without some of the yennifer stuff and I wasnt a fan of triss but I did like that we see Soden and thought what they made works for a show. I love the lore of the world but seeing as the two obviously dont exist at the same time, I just see it as another take
George, i am not very involved in the witcher community. Because i recently started watching your videos, I like your videos and what you do.<br><br>But i feel like you say sorry to much because you have a diffrent opinion.<br>Thats okay mate. Just dont say sorry to much and be affraid of it.<br>Your true fans will never hate you for saying you dont like the show.<br>You have ever right to say and find that.<br><br>Keep your head high. And keep going like you are.<br>I enjoy watching your videos! Keep it up mate!
Right, I was worried about Cavill but he was actually a stand out performance. Costumes designer has been sacked which I‚Äôm happy about as the wig stood out and those ball sack armours... wow. I think Yennefer I cared about her at first but by the 5th episode I was sick of seeing her story. I think the race push by the SJW writers was very blatant but I didn‚Äôt really care that much except the girls in the woods. You‚Äôll have to drink the water to show if you have a bad heart... literally let a Doppler serial killer come and take the kid without making him drink. Makes perfect sense.  Yennefer really got on my nerves by the end of it, still thought she was weak as fuck. How many times does she want to prove her worth. I wanted more Geralt and monsters... not CGI ones though I‚Äôm already sick of the CGI.  the last episode left me disappointed with Geralt just laying in a carriage. It‚Äôs set up all these villains but there‚Äôs no pay off at the end. Also just have to add... those time jumps were the most confusing things ever. Sitting there at episode 4 and the king and queen re appear I had no fucking clue what was going on I felt like I‚Äôd missed something.
I&#39;m gonna have to respectfully disagree with you. I don&#39;t need everything to be exactly as it was in the books, in fact I think things like giving Yennefer a proper backstory makes it a lot more interesting. That is not to say that all of your criticisms are invalid (I agree with what you said About the fight between Vilgefortz and Cahir, for example), but they just don&#39;t bother me as much.<br><br>That being said, Merry Christmas to all of you!
Agree with your points.
I absolutely adore the books and am so invested in the lore. That said, I do enjoy the show. I am more than happy to loosen up on my opinions to just enjoy seeing parts of the world in live action and take what I can get.
They should fire the directors. This isn‚Äôt the Witcher. This is yennefer the witch and maybe geralt here and there. Show could have been good. Yennefer isn‚Äôt well done in the show. Geralt likes to get ko too much. The alchemy is non existent. Horrible horrible horrible organization of the timeline. They re making the past and present happen at the same time for different characters. I only knew what was happening because I was familiar with the lore and timeline. None of the characters are built up at all to make you like them. Timeskips happen and you have to assume that they happened. Like yennefer makes a mess and acts like a rebellious child and makes a mistake that the rest of the series she is trying to correct then next thing you know it‚Äôs been 30 years and you only know because she casually mentions it. Like casually. Then they go back and forth between the past and present. It‚Äôs just bad bad bad directing. Certain characters are made to look like someone you re supposed to hate. Monster hunts are skipped entirely. All you see is after the monster is killed. Witcher‚Äôs don‚Äôt seem powerful at all. Fight scenes are short and anticlimactic and rushed. Some scenes make no sense. Like the ending where Ciri meets geralt for the first time and runs into his arms. Wtf...The romantic chemistry is horrible too.
I haven&#39;t read the books, played the games multiple times and I&#39;m a massive fan. Watched this show and really enjoyed it
I Think your right in all of your point
Whether people like this show or not they have to admit this show thus far is a piss poor adaptation of the books. Triss,yennefer and ciris story,stregobor,vilgefortz,cahir,the dryads,the battle of sodden and cintra,the woke castings and so much more
No movie/tv producers are ever strictly canon to the source material.  If so, that would leave them no room for creativity.  Creative people  want to explore their creativeness , as artist,  just like what the producers of Witcher 3 did. Even though I&#39;m obsessed with the books, I respect Netflix&#39;s creative adaptations , and I&#39;m excited about how they choose to move forward.
Dude you should never have to apologise for your opinion, difference is what makes the world great, anyway I‚Äôve never read the books or the game and I personally really enjoyed the show as I‚Äôm a massive fan of this genre however I fully understand the feeling of loving a book and tv/ movie completely ruining it (see eragon üòëüò≠ and wheel of time) and it‚Äôs possibly the most infuriating thing watching something and constantly thinking ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs just plain wrong‚Äù , issue is I now want to read the books but know it will ruin the show üòÇ but no matter what the book will ALWAYS be better but still keep up the vids as they‚Äôre still amazing
I&#39;m a a reader of the books, and I can honestly say you didn&#39;t nitpick at all. I think the show was okay. I watched it again and I let go of my views on the book and see it as something separate unfortunately but most of the changes are just unnecessary!
Basically it‚Äôs 1/3 a retelling of Geralt‚Äôs greatest hits from the short stories but getting key character aspects and impactful moments wrong, 1/3 an unneeded backstory for Yen that makes hugely stupid lore changes and takes away the mystique that was crucial to her character, and 1/3 Ciri wandering around because...filler. They should have just done Blood of Elves, taken out the unnecessary stuff in that book and filled the rest of the time with flashbacks to the short stories that impact the main plot. But I suspect they‚Äôre trying to stretch the book content as much as possible. Pretty sure the show runner has said she wants to use the rest of the short stories if she can.
I agree with much of your video. I‚Äôve read all books and video games, too. I hate the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù material content in the series. Almost all of it is unnecessary.
The whole season was a disjointed mess.  It ended on a giant plot hole.  The best actors were relegated to bit parts and background characters.  The main character was not the main character.  Most of the story focused on an unlikable witch.  I&#39;m convinced that the casting director was drunk.  Oh, and the whole setup for season 2 felt like it should have been the setup for episode 2.  Other than that, it was...  okay?<br>P.S.  &quot;Adaption&quot; ish not a word.  hic*
I  have come to believe after listening to you over a long time that you just love listening to your own voice and have no idea of what you are talking about
Watched 5 and 6 this afternoon. Some VERY unnecessary deaths, I feel. Not to mention the problem with the &quot;dragons&quot;, namely they aren&#39;t dragons.<br><br>All in all, Geralt and Jaskier, even Yennefer, make the show worthwhile. Whereas Ciri isn&#39;t allowed to be her own character. Dara is there to do what Ciri did on her own.<br><br>So far, 6/10.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcpmD5J8xOk&amp;t=17m39s"">17:39</a> You aren&#39;t alone. Luke didn&#39;t like Luke in the Last Jedi either lol
I liked the show. Can&#39;t wait till season 2. It&#39;s well paced and even though they change some things this is far better than not having a  Witcher series at all.
If you watch it with book/game knowledge beforehand, you may not think it‚Äôs a stellar show. If you have no prior knowledge at all then I probably would recommend it to someone, but it‚Äôs not something that lives up to other quality adaptations like Game of Thrones for example, which people have been trying to predict.<br><br>For me, even with very minimal book knowledge and most game knowledge coming from Witcher 3, I still finished the show thinking that a lot of things were very off and didn‚Äôt feel right. However, I‚Äôve recommended it to my girlfriend who doesn‚Äôt know much about it, and so far she likes it.
Sorry guys, but I think this deserves Witcher fans&#39; love <a href=""https://youtu.be/5GLtk2cLRu4"">https://youtu.be/5GLtk2cLRu4</a>
Honestly I dont get all the bitching about the mistake armor. The books describe them as looking like the ball skin and the armor in the show looks like ball skin so really what&#39;s the fucking problem?
I agree and disagree, for me its a 7/10 , not as bad as it could have been, but not as good, and skipping really important things to add fluff is just awful and sad. I guess for me it&#39;s a &quot;better than nothing&quot; with low to mild hopes of improvement.
They changed way too many parts lore- and storywise. I&#39;m so disappointed.
Looks like the old Wied≈∫min TV show did a better job portraying some of the early Witcher stories while operating on a shoestring budget than whatever this is is supposed to be.
I liked it, 8/10 but what was slavic about this? you tell me, I always thought northern kingdom was slavic, holy roman empire with control from rome (behind the alps) was nilfgaards that came from behind the mountains, ands skellige with viking and british name was viking rule under danelaw etc. Also, I just... triss. what a boring character she was in this show. jesus christ was that a horrible character. Also, if you wwanna represent &quot;diversity&quot; and minorities&quot; what about gingers? my grandma was a ginger, a red haired one, they arnt exacly &quot;beloved&quot; or used a lot in tv shows either.
I enjoyed the season.  It&#39;s not without problems, regardless of it not being close to the books or not.
What you said is what I was actually thinking the whole time watching this show. I feel like if you read the first two books I don&#39;t think you will like this show that much. Too much stuff was changed and the time line stuff was just not needed. If this season just focused on the first book it would of been alot better. Plus when was magic so similar to equivalent exchange I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t like that in the books. Yes please do a nity picky vid cause I was doing it while watching :).
Games player only here, And i totally agree with you. Tho i still enjoyed the show and i look forward to season 2. But man so much is done so weirdly.<br>Even tho i didn&#39;t know about the books i still found the magic system absurd in the show.
Highly enjoying the show, but it is objectively terrible xD
I want that very nitpicky video
If I want to be objective, it&#39;s a 6/10 show not the best but it&#39;s a decent show, I get why people like it. I personally dislike it, not a good adaptation to much unnecessary changes. (And I have some not really nice thing to say to the designer..)
So you enjoy changes made in the games from the books but suddenly when the show does it you hate it?
THIS! I needed a video like this so much and thank you for making it. I love the witcher but i dont have the time to read the books sadly so i wanted the opinion of someone that has read them and knows the lore. Even without reading the books and just the knowledge i have from the games i could tell that something felt very off with the show. Despite the boat load of changes they made i do like it, i just wish they would have stuck closer to source material. I feel like the show is doing a good job in certain scenes that you cant see anywhere else but as a whole it sorta missed the mark, the one word that comes to mind when i think about this show would be &quot;Missguided.&quot; I do hope they can turn the ship around for season 2 though.
I hate what they did to nilffguard... And their armor... I had to enter game to see their awesome black steel armor with winged helmet. ^^
This seems like a nitpicking video....whennnn you said you wouldn‚Äôt.
Really good review. They definitely changed a lot from the books and some of it can be explained as choices made to modernize (feminize) the show. I do believe that this show has potential to get better.
You can&#39;t really say what they did was wrong,  it&#39;s their creative choice. It&#39;s not like they are trying to follow everything perfectly and just flat out getting it wrong. I think instead of saying its wrong you should say it differs in the books or whatever. But yeah there are some stuff I believe they should and could of kept in the show that would of been better, but like I said you cant say it was wrong, just a difference but hopefully they will learn.
I liked it, didn&#39;t think it was great. For example, I quite loved the first episode, but I didn&#39;t like the second episode. The Sylvan looked really weird and the fact that they left out the lady of the fields really bugged me.
I definitely appreciate that noticed the odd Nilfgaardians being pure evil, Cahir problems and the issues with Aretuza and Frangila too. Enough changes like that will tear the heart out of the rich lore of a series.
From not reading the books and only playing the games i liked the show but after this I really want to read the books now because i do want to understand what they have changed
I loved the witcher n i agree with u...why they change so much
I dont think they represented the books badly I enjoyed the way they portrayed the world
it was nice to see an attempt at some of the stores that whether you come from the games or the books you would have at least heard about the knights and the dinner and the strega the jinn but ya they did change allot its was kinda upsetting but also just the complete character changes like yen and triss i mean triss is stronger then what they put in the show there was just very few like count on a single hand moments that felt witcher and tho if they make more seasons ill watch its not the best
Although I get all of your points, I really don&#39;t care about any of them. I have read the books aswell as playing the games. It is still something more about the universe. Reading the books has made me enjoy it more to be honest.
the books are a disaster of English translation so far, I find the books mediocre at best, after book 1.  But I can&#39;t understand the Polish language. The show is outstanding overall, critics are way off on this one...
I think everything you have said is SPOT ON!!!!! I agree 100% thank you for saying what it is and not being afraid to. I have so much respect for you
Watching the first episode I immediately noticed big plot changes but I kept going knowing it‚Äôs an adaptation. Now after 3 episodes I‚Äôm already exhausted with all the changes. An example is how they changed the reason yennefer and most sorceresses are infertile. The show changed it to the ‚Äúplastic surgery‚Äù that she gets. Changes to people and events can be endured to a point but changing something fundamental to the creative universe crosses the line no matter what.
My main issue is why they&#39;d drop so many great, episodic, short stories. Cherrypicking will hurt the overall story. I also feel a closer adaptation would be faaaar better the changes are jarring.<br><br>Small spoils below don&#39;t read if you don&#39;t want!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The actress playing Triss had almost no material to work with for her performance it seems, seeing as Triss is only name dropped in the prequel short stories which this series is telling. <br>Her appearance in the Striga story was a odd show addition replacing the role of both Foltest and Nenneke, due to the shift in framing device, which was silly IMO The Last Wish already had a great framing story. I suppose it was because if Ciri wasn&#39;t in the show til season 2 people might be confused.<br><br><br>Yennefer&#39;s lack of thick curly hair was my biggest complaint, She&#39;s always described as having long curly hair: &quot;her hair which, he found, had retained its picturesque, dishevelled and curling disarray despite the furious combing.&quot; but both the game and now series seem to hate on Yen&#39;s curls.<br><br><br>Nilfgaard&#39;s armor and lack of accent, mages having more freedom than Northern ones, along with how Fringilla &amp; Cahir is now cartoonishly evil or something? Despite both being pivotal saga characters. Big yikes.<br><br><br>Calathe was done well although the lack of silvery hair and green eyes to match her daughter and grandaughter was odd.<br><br>The Dryad&#39;s using crossbows was a really weird one, they&#39;re the greatest archers in lore using the weapon designed for people who couldn&#39;t use bows well? Okay. (please don&#39;t make Milwa a crossbow user).<br><br><br>They skipped so many good stories in the Last Wish book (I still feel betrayed by that version of &#39;Edge of the World&#39;) and I fear they&#39;re going to skip the rest of Sword of Destiny seeing as it&#39;s ending has already happened. (No &#39;A Little Sacrifice&#39; will be a big mistake for the series, as it&#39;s THE most powerful short story in the entire series).<br><br><br>Vilgefortz, what the hell is going on with you buddy? You can&#39;t beat Cahir in a fight? Big oof for moving forwards, if they follow the saga anyway.<br><br><br><br><br>On the up side Henry was amazing, although he&#39;s still too pretty and thicc for the role of a wirey, ugly, scarred monster slayer but the games made it work.<br><br><br>Seeing the battle of Sodden Hill was cool, although it was just a very large hill in the books (Where the mages stood anyway) and Triss&#39; and Yen&#39;s fates changed it seems.
I liked the series and I‚Äôve read the books. I don‚Äôt think the series could ever live up to the books but I wasn‚Äôt expecting much before the series and was pleasantly surprised. I can also see how you as someone who is so invested into every bit of lore the books have to offer would be annoyed with the changes the series made. Everyones entitled to their own opinion.
I will watch this video. But before I need to watch the season.
its a terible sjw agenda and this shitstain of a show doesnt derserve the name &quot;the witcher&quot;
Great video
I agree with you but not everything is perfect if the people would have made it exactly like the books we would have 20+ seasons which is great in my opinion I love the witcher and I&#39;ve wanted a witcher show for years so we just have to  make the best of it.
I totally agree with your review, I am completely lost as to how people are enjoying it, the acting and writing seems so childish, thanks for being honest.
it was good but not great
Cahir armour and nilfgaard is just terrible
You should have been cited and used. I wish they had touched on some of the finer things, however I enjoyed  the show thoroughly.  I expected  to see at least a drowner. One necrophage fight was decent but he shouldn&#39;t  have that weak. I expected  him to igni. Yey he got bit.
I&#39;ve read  the books and played the games. Though a lot of things were off in the show, I quite liked it. I was initially annoyed with the abrupt timeline jumps in the  first few episodes but when the timelines came together it looked really good. I liked the fact that they made up Yen&#39;s origin story  and it was quite good. If you really wanna enjoy the show just don&#39;t get pissed if everything is not directly adapted from the books.
The whole show is ridiculous.
Hi guys I&#39;d just like to leave this comment here asking everyone to watch the whole video before judging my opinion. I feel as if I was quite respectful to those of you that might disagree with me because as I said in the video I didn&#39;t and will never make a video with the intention of upsetting someone or with the intention of telling them I&#39;m right and they&#39;re wrong. Everyone has different opinion&#39;s on things and I think it&#39;s just better if we all just respect that we each have different opinions and move on. You&#39;re all great regardless of your view on a tv show and I hope you all have a great Christmas!
I think it&#39;s a good show but regardless of it being based on the books, the games are still the more engrossing experience by far. Even just from a narrative standpoint.
Before I watch the full video, I was going to go ahead a post my opinion about it, I have never read any of the Books but I came into the Witcher Series by the second game and have played all of them and I liked the show on some cases but it was really confusing because I didn‚Äôt realize it was going back and forth With Geralt and Ciri but I‚Äôm only on episode 7 and I want to read the books soon.
It was okay, but too much subtle political messages. The books and games are better. The series is okay but certainly nothing that amazed me.
they&#39;ve already fired the costume designer, which was basically my biggest problem. Geralt&#39;s wig, Nilfgaard armor, Cintra armor, bleh. Let&#39;s hope S2 will be better in term of aesthetics.
Thought you were gonna go episode by episode? I&#39;m only on episode three.<br><br>My reaction so far is meh. But also sometimes the flaws someone points out may be mistaken. You can dislike or misunderstand something. So don&#39;t forget that and keep an open mind of criticism of your criticism.
Love you videos keep it up !
Black triss, and Indian yenn, wtf
I quite liked it."
k5S62lVAuy8,"Season 2 was absolute trash compared to season 1
Just finished watching so came here to read the comments.  I am surprised how very forgiving and generous most commenters are here.  I thought S2 was pretty rubbish.  I know it is not cannon to the books but S1 was still more enjoyable.  S2&#39;s story-telling was a mess, dialogue pretty bad and the plot totally convoluted.  You&#39;re watching and you&#39;d have a &quot;WTF&quot; moment every 10 minutes or so of every episode.  And it&#39;s not because you didn&#39;t read the books either cuz it was not based on the books.  Episode 1 was quite good and promising but sadly it was steep downhill from there.  Bad story-telling, bad writing.  Acting and production quality was very good but doesn&#39;t not make up for pretty horrible story-telling and it was a bad story too.  So much great stuff in the books and games but they chose to go with this crap instead it&#39;s mind-boggling.  Disappointed.
I was introduced to Witcher lore through the Netflix series, then played Witcher 3 and read all of the novels and developed a much deeper love for the characters, lore, and story. With that being said, Season 2 was a MONUMENTAL disappointment; not because they couldn‚Äôt fit all the stories and nuance into each episode, but because the show runner betrayed the character of each of the main members. Vesemir is supposedly the oldest remaining Witcher, but he‚Äôs frail and gullible in the show. What‚Äôs worse is that Geralt has to be his moral compass instead of the other way around. Yennifer took Ciri in like a mother and would have gladly given her life for Ciri, and in the show, she‚Äôs ready to trade her in like the latest edition of Call of Duty at GameStop. Eskel is a soft spoken, yet faithful Witcher, but the show depicts him as rowdy and reckless. There are myriad other examples, but it‚Äôs all spittle in the faces of Witcher fans. I‚Äôm disgusted by it.
Heres my thought in the comments below. Youre a shill
0/10 show
The games take place after the books end. So this TV strictly takes place in the realm of the books. Only time we see Ciri in the games is in the final game The Witcher 3 where she is 20 something.
Finished watching the series and I thought it was GREAT  - though some parts confused me as someone who read the books.<br>Some things that NEED to be done in season 3 for CERTAIN UPCOMING events to feel BELIEVABLE are the following:<br>1 - They need to show us CIRI practice and get a lot BETTER with the SWORD.<br>2 - They need VILGEFORTZ to show off his POWER as a SORCERER (he was a WIMP in season 1 - he needs to get a lot stronger somehow).<br>3 - If JARRE is going to have any similar storyline to what he has in the books he NEEDS to SPEND MORE TIME with CIRI.<br><br>The first two are a MUST for me for future event credibility. What are your thoughts?
Who makes a review without even finishing the finale? LOL
u look like charlie sheen
Season 2 much better than season 1
I didn&#39;t like season 2, first one was much stronger and less banal.
Anybody notice how the music was so bland &amp; &quot;under&quot; and just not as good as in season 2?  It didn&#39;t transport me or put me in the &quot;feels&quot; like s1. This criticism includes the bard, Jaskier&#39;s &quot;Burn Witcher Burn,&quot; tune. Not as catchy as &quot;Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,&quot; ditty which soared!!
Season 2 is outstanding. Hope they continue to improve. Star Trek TNG season one was kinda junky too, after that, all pretty great.
Well, so far I am extremely bored with the  new season...
I kinda secretly liked season 1, hoped it would improve. <br>Season 2 is complete and utter gutter trash though. <br>They made everything that sucked about season 1 worse and have improved on nothing. <br>Pretty dissapointed, won&#39;t watch any of this shit again, that is for sure.
One small correction. The TV show is based on the books, not the games.
It doesn&#39;t stick to the source material at all! This is not an adaptation, this is poorly written fan fiction.
Already watched it
It&#39;s awfully boring, and they stuffed too many black and brown actors in the show, so the whole Northeastern European feel is gone completely.
I‚Äôm bingeing all day on Sunday lol
I agree, while reading the books I thought Ciri was the Arya Stark of the Witcher and then some more. Such a complicated character that keeps evolving and going through so much. I was worried Freya Allen wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to portrait her properly
Oooh! I been so excited about this,  tisaya, yennefer &amp; geralt &lt;(OwO)&lt; &gt;(0w0)&gt;
We didn‚Äôt get through the first season, thought it was terrible‚Ä¶I tried for Henry Cavill who I could stare at all day
I know you most probably won&#39;t see my comment but in case you do please answer some of my questions. Have they improved the ost or is it still the same generic Americanized feel to it? We need the Slavic feel to come to the show like this kind of music it is one of the minor problems for me in s1. We want music like this.<br><a href=""https://youtu.be/pf-VR2unj7s"">https://youtu.be/pf-VR2unj7s</a><br><a href=""https://youtu.be/8UMhLMspr18"">https://youtu.be/8UMhLMspr18</a><br>Also do they explain what Ciri is and what her powers are well or they massacre her whole arc? Ciri&#39;s powers are the most important thing in the whole Witcher universe and if they mess this up it is going to be disappointing. Ciri is the most powerful being in the whole universe and in s1 they didn&#39;t handle it that well. How much do they reveal about the Elder Blood this season? Do they even mention it at all?
Thanks for the great review! Hope you do a follow up after you get to finish the last two episodes.
Of course it‚Äôs on my binge list, are you kidding!?  I‚Äôm taking this afternoon off to binge final time most of season one, then I have tomorrow off so I can finish off one and perhaps binge season two. After the first episode I‚Äôll probably break and consider whether I want to take a break before episode two.  Anyway, thank you for a quality review.  Much of what you said are things I have been hoping to see in season two so I‚Äôm even more excited about it now.  To answer your final question, what do I like most about the Witcher? There are a lot of things I like about it, but I think the answer is that it fills a void and need for escape into a completely different world of fantastical elements as well as real human themes that I‚Äôm thinking about right now in my life. It provides a deep world of kind I recognize from fantasy novels I read as a teenager, when they provided a similar refuge.   I really like the character of Yennifer as written and so successfully portrayed by Anya.  Her life trajectories are fulfilling I think the mature woman who has succeeded in her career goals, but finds something missing, and who thinks about the past and the decisions one has made and paths taken and personal outcomes we are not happy about.  Then there is the theme of destiny, which is mostly treated in light fashion in the show, but with respect to Jennifer it is the most meaningful.  Is there such a thing as fate? How much of where we are in our lives is due to chance and how much is the future we created for ourselves.  I recognize the sadness and loss Yennifer feels and I interested to see her grow and find a way to become more fulfilled and happy with herself and her life.
I did NOT like the First Season of The Witcher. It was FULL of Bad Acting and Predictable Storylines. That would&#39;ve  been O.K. if the Action/Fight Scenes matched the EXPERTLY Choreographed Scuffles of the VIDEO GAME trailers and Movie Clips. Instead, we got the Multi-Angle &quot;Can Hardly See Who&#39;s punching&quot; Scenes we see in EVERY Action Movie (trying to stay within INSURANCE Guidelines). This will go on the &quot;Watch When BORED&quot; List
So , will season 2 be more faithful to the books than season 1 ?
Great review, thank you. Having read the books twice and knowing something about the story arc and style of  background material - it will be interesting to see how tv adaption will cope with it. The books themselves are very very dialogue driven - the politics are not explained but displayed in characters speech in most cases. Racial prejudice and injustice is one key theme - it is a grim world for just about everybody. Luckily the books are written and the story exists - so hopefully they get to show it all to us. Can not wait!
Just saw ep 1 &#39;early release&#39; (ahem). Pretty good. I really like the good/evil duality and how evil can take substance and form. I think in the books/games (from memory) a Witcher&#39;s code prohibits them from killing sentient &#39;monsters&#39; (or maybe it&#39;s just Geralt). The theory being, if a creature has a choice and isn&#39;t just compelled to kill, then it&#39;s men&#39;s problem, not the Witchers&#39;. Which is why the decision to kill Vereena is obvious, even though she is clearly sentient, she cannot control her urges, as much as we might sympathise with her (men are after all, far more evil and destructive at times). She is therefore a monster by the Witcher definition and must be destroyed.<br><br>What I love most about the books/world? Probably the references and connection with wolves, being by favourite animals (apart from dogs! :).<br>I&#39;m also probably one of the few who dislikes the series adaptation of Yennefer, who I find 1-dimensional, narcissistic and utterly self-serving, with few if any redeeming qualities (unlike in the games).
I noticed that you must have a working relationship with Netflix cause of all your early screeners. I‚Äôm looking to get into the review business I just want to know if they reached out to you when your following grew or did u reach out to them? Thanks for your time.
Toss a coin to chris!
Yeah, I played The Witcher 3 and had the box-set thingy, with extra content (whole extra stories) like Blood And Wine, etc. I was swept up in Geralt‚Äôs world and had that awesome experience of introducing a younger player to the game, which was totally new to him.  He has that box set of mine now, which I will never get back, but I‚Äôm fine with that.<br>	What I really enjoyed about Season 1 was the none linear story telling, which threw me a little at first, in a way that was enjoyable.  And, like with a video game, it went off on side quests and mini-stories, coming back to the main events once those were wrapped up, which was very much in keeping with how people experience a video game (when you think about it) of this, third person, open world, adventure type, at any rate. <br>	The scripts were slick, the effects were for the most part rather good, the action was memorable and the performances are all seriously committed, so what‚Äôs not to love?  Very much looking forward to season two, as season one was one of the highlights of Netflix last year, for me.  Now you‚Äôve given it your seal of approval, I can‚Äôt wait. ‚úåÔ∏è
Tried liking this, but just couldn&#39;t get into it. In season I, the writing was a mess, the plot was impossible to believe, and while there were some notable moments, the acting seemed forced and sterile. The Witcher is a watered-down LOTR rip-off.
hype!
Dang it, it&#39;s not out yet? As soon as your review started, I texted my friend who is a MASSIVE fan and got me into watching it, too. I guess I&#39;ll get some confused texts back...
Huge fan of the Witcher games here. Loved the first season and it so Good to know that season 2 is better. Thanks for the early review. So gonna binged it now ‚ù§Ô∏è
To be honest, I found the first season really boring, with too little focus on Geralt himself.
How? I can&#39;t see it on my Netflix now
Dang - how did you get to see this early?
&quot; respect Witcher&quot;
I love it.  Gonna binge it."
DuSMAj0lGis,"SUPERMAN!  GERALT!  Fans win!
I wonder if Austin still feels this way after the show now, after the hype has died. I suppose he would still keep the same views of this season. If you liked it you liked it.
Like what Netflix is doing with this serie. Giving us an animated movie and a prequel series keeps us hooked on the Witcher.
If you are a witcher fan its not good. Its you are a random viewer its ok-good
This season felt like a CW show. Pretty good first season, then devolves into the most predictable plot elements ever. Oh no! Yennefer is gonna cut off Cahir&#39;s head! oh wait she didn&#39;t wow. The evil mother witch lady was so clich√©, as soon as you saw her particles floating around you knew she would take over Ciri. I can&#39;t be the only one who felt zero investment or feeling for any of the characters. All the emotional moments were so bland and predictable. Dandelion and Geralt is the only good parts of the show. The last episode battle looked really cool, but it felt like there were no stakes. The evil mother lady was more annoying than scary when she was on screen and they only explain who she is like 6 episodes into the show! Very disappointed in this series. Why make up garbage when you have a fantastic story at your fingertips?
This season was meh.. for me lot of talking and fillers couldn‚Äôt watch after episode 2! Action was great though
Well done as always Austin.  But I disagree with your high score for S2 and also how The timeline in S1 was presented it was not hard to follow but I know a lot of people seemed to have difficulty following it.  Season 1 was better in my opinion and also S2 seems more of a set-up season for things to come.  Also I am still very troubled about the casting of Fringilla Vigo but the casting has been a point of contention for many, many people. Not only myself.
What is ‚Äúba‚Äù?
Episode 1 was very good. Then when we got into the main story was like... meh. I foind myself missing season 1
Unpopular opinion: I liked season 1 more even with its issues. I see what season 2 does well, but for me was kind of bland.
Idk thought this season was kinda average
what a ridiculous high score for such a subpar season and show
It&#39;s just as amazing as Got season 8 and netflix deathnote. love it. can&#39;t wait to see what they&#39;ll do to lotr
It was dope!
Its interesting netflix only send out the first 6 episodes. Because I like them way more then S1. You still notice when the writers made a lot of changes because things stop making much sense more often then not. But generaly quite good, then the it jumps of clif during episode 8...
Not even close to 90%
this show puts me to sleep everythime.
Do you make any honest reviews? Why is it that every series or movie you review seems like you were paid to give it a good review? First of all, the Witcher season 2 is terrible. Secondly you said episode 1 is the best of all 6 episodes......how can the first 40 minutes of a season be the best minutes, and you expect us to believe that the season is good? Dude stop being nice with these reviews, stop lying man, in what universe does this resemble anything good???
I think you will be surprised with how the season ends, but good kind of surprised.
Absolute snooze fest. Terrible show.
netflix witcher sucks
Haha cool
The witcher season 2 was meh
Well season 2 is complete diffrent than what is in books. This is like better Herkules or Xena. I am serious with this.
When are you getting that nose job?
This was 10000000% awesome season
I loved The Witcher 3, and Henry Cavil was a great casting choice for Geralt, but the writing and directing of this show was a disappointment. I wish it did the game justice. This show felt cheap and naive, almost like a soap opera at times. What a shame.
Besides the main 3 characters and the  bard, it felt boring and I didn‚Äôt seem to care about the others
if you read the books and play the games.<br>this season is a disappointment.
One thing that annoyed me so much about season 2 was how everything was explained to the audience. The characters explained their motives and backgrounds, which is something they wouldn&#39;t do in reality. The writers dumbed down this season A LOT. Which is annoying, because viewers aren&#39;t stupid. We don&#39;t need the storyline spoon-fed to us. It&#39;s much better to have the mystery and to actually use our brains to figure it out. Which is what made season 1 so amazing. Also, was anyone else bothered by Yennifer&#39;s script and performance in season 2? It was like she was a totally different character from season 1, and not for the better.
A lot of signs usage this season. Very cool fight scenes.
Love it! Don‚Äôt spoil it
I‚Äôm a newcomer. It‚Äôs a bit much. But I‚Äôm getting the story. Almost. A lot of names, that‚Äôs a bit difficult to follow
I loved the series but I am so angry that Yennefer was so powerless. I wanted to see more of her. I wanted her fighting, summoning lightning and fire, but she was just there doing nothing. She&#39;s useful but they made her so weak. She deserved more. Such interesting character and wasted.
I&#39;m after 2nd season and I&#39;m dissappointed. They threw out everyhing great from books and they filled empty spaces with their &quot;original&quot; stupid ideas. The show is full of is full of narrative, fictional and acting holes and even Henry can&#39;t save it. I feel sorry for him, like a fan for a fan whose dreams of a decent adaptation have been trampled on by incompetent people.
It was shit.
He is most definitely more buff and preparation out just right lol. My sister and I noticed it immediately üòÖ he had never looked this good lol the show is amazing
Something about the writing is top notch this season for me, the way the characters interact, how they speak and react, so human and real for me
This is not the adaptation, this is not even loose adaptation. This is the story with the characters with similar names. <br>Bottom of the bottom
season two was so bad, all the characters are whiny and annoying, story doesn&#39;t make much sense, fights are boring, effects are shit, Eskel story was butchered, and the finale was ridiculous, yay, power of friendship solves everything, what a bs
My advice when you read the novels (I‚Äôm one myself): Please don‚Äôt compare them to each other, because you‚Äôll get annoyed the entire time. They changed so much. I stopped comparing it to the novels after episode 4 and it was way more enjoyable.
Its trash. If you like second season you have trash taste. Actors- trash, storytelling- trash, music- trash, Eskel badass- trash idea, yen and ciri relationship- trash. I‚Äôm so hate this show like book reader. It‚Äôs not mean I won‚Äôt page by page. No. I just want normal witcher without changing character motivations, minds, and other staff. They ruined all Slavic atmosphere and now it‚Äôs just common serial about some magic in some minded world. Completely trash. Why all Slavic community hate this show, but Americans so much love, can anyone explain me this?
So they focus more on Geralt? Yennefer easily had the most screen time last season and it seemed like another bait and switch show.
I really encourage everyone to read books. You will find out how awful this season is ;)
As someone who read the books, this was hot shit. Honestly terrible and depressing to watch. Also you must be blind, that CGI was atrocious
SPOILER ALERT<br><br><br><br>Even though I don‚Äôt know everything about the lore of the books and the games so I don‚Äôt know how accurate everything is, this season felt quite‚Ä¶rushed I guess. The finale twist which I knew all the way back during season one felt rushed. Yen‚Äôs entire character felt very unnecessary until the finale and her moments training Ciri. I think the main problem I didn‚Äôt like was that The Wild Hunt and The Emperor didn‚Äôt feel like it they were built up well enough. Everything felt like they were rushing to get to the end for the twist. I really enjoyed the elves however and the mages however. I also loved Fringella‚Äôs character
Attention to detail!!?? <br>Triss merigold says hi<br>Netflix ruined the witcher
I don&#39;t understand the surprise that the second series is already linear - they go by the books, and the books are linear from that point on as well.
Visuals, CGI is top. The rest (except episode1)  has nothing to do with books and must be huge disappointment for anyone who read the books....  3/10 not more
I hope they conclude the story. Lot&#39;s of interesting things happened in this seasons that I want to see the conclusion to.
Bro this season made me fall in love with Geralt, this guy knows his shit and it&#39;s so believable. This is probably Cavills&#39; best work
Loved the season 2,  but they still need to use that incredible soundtrack more.<br>And arteuza &#39;s politics is boring but djikstra can make it spicy.
Season 1 was a 6, 2 was a 7, 90% is succession good? How do you come out with this number?
I loved the episodic stories in the first season but the whole grand story of nilfgaard and aretuza was extremely weak for how much screen time it got. Nilfgaard and aretuza are important to the world, but they really dont pay off in a satisfying way since it is SO separate from geralt who is the heart of the show. I wish they did less aretuza world building, made yennefers arc more centered around her interactions with geralt for the first season, and introduced nilfgaard in season 2.
Awesome review
Season 1 sucked. So does this season
I&#39;ve found this season a bit boring so far. Hope it gets better.
Great review, glad I found your channel. I may not agree with everything but I <b>really</b> appreciate that you take the time/have the ability to cite examples to back up your statements. As a book reader, I felt there were many times where they needlessly changed elements of the plot making it slightly less coherent and compelling. <br><br>Your one real criticism about how when they diverge from the core Ciri/Geralt team things aren&#39;t as engaging is certainly valid and ties in with mine regarding those needless changes. In the book, the secondary and tertiary characters &#39;bounce off&#39; Geralt, Ciri and their story so it&#39;s <b>remains</b> compelling throughout. <br><br>Other than that, I truly enjoyed it and since I nit-picked changes from the book, I feel it&#39;s only fair to give the writers credit for what I feel they translated beautifully, namely the characterizations of Triss and Geralt. They absolutely nailed it with those two!
I binge watched the whole season yesterday, and I cannot wait for season 3! I haven&#39;t been this excited for a show since game of thrones!
its really hard to adapt from the books , please give it a rest. i loved he show as a gamer didnt read the books
Wish Geralt was in it.
Lol book nerds need to give it a rest, yeah it&#39;s not like the books not many people have read the book too so just chill and watch something different, I hope critics don&#39;t kill this show because even though I do think season 1 was better both are still class and I do want to watch future seasons and maybe they can get a better budget for it.
Just finished it. Soooo goood!! Much better then S1 ü§å
Read the books
What a cliff hanger!!!!üò±
The witcher got famous coz of the games, so fuk the book. The games differed from the book too so thats that.
I watched s1 and liked it so much that I read every book except the last. So this season seemed very off to me. But can someone clarify for me that read the books. Was ciris father mentioned this early on? I mean they said who he was in episode 8. I thought they revealed him in the 5th or 6th book I read . Reading the books messed up how I saw the show this 2nd season I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh through each episode like it was a comedy. And im African American and I see a lot of comments about this but I too can‚Äôt get over how frigilla was described in the books vs the show. Show Ciri was not like book ciri to me
Season two was good and the trailer for that prequel or spin-off series at end of episode 8 seems interesting spoilers if haven‚Äôt watched season two
For some reason I kept getting bored at everything that didn‚Äôt have the Witcher in it. It just felt flat and boring
Honestly this season was tragically bad. It‚Äôs like the showrunner had the perfect recipe but then decided to throw it all out the window. The best analogy is I can make is you‚Äôre making a raspberry pie, and the recipe is great. So all you have to do is follow that recipe. But instead of doing that the showrunner decided to add pork chops to it. Why? Because fuck you I guess? Spoiler alert:<br><br><br><br>As someone who has read the books twice I feel like I‚Äôm fairly well versed in the story, yet the series leave me wondering what the fuck is going on. Several great characters completely ruined. <br><br>For example let‚Äôs take Eskil, a really loveable character. At first Ciri is a little afraid of him because of his scarred face, but he is not even CLOSE to what they depict him as in the series. I actually didn‚Äôt even recognise that to be Eskil until Ciri said his name because of how far his character was from the books. He was also just thrown away in the ‚ÄúLeshen‚Äù attack or whatever the fuck you call that tragedy which also, never happens in the books.<br><br>Ciri is twice the age of what she is in the book, Freya is 20 and supposed to be playing the role of Ciri who is supposed to be 10 as of when season 1. <br><br>Yennifer is also completely ruined, not only does she get way too much screen time, but she is also way less confident than what she is in the books, and in the books she also never loses her magic. Which brings me in to<br><br>The undying witch or whatever. I still don‚Äôt even get what it is. It has no even close relation to the books what so ever, and is such a dumb concept.<br><br>Honestly I could go on for hours. This show is an absolute tragedy and I can‚Äôt help but feel bad for all the talented people who worked on this, only for it to be completely ruined because the showrunner didn‚Äôt bother reading the source material.
Should have also waited for the last two episodes. They were the best of the whole season.
Season 2 is a solid 5. Really bad writing.
Fringilla had a really interesting story arc too. I didn‚Äôt even care about her character but now I want to see how it all plays out.
I really love this season it felt like a continuation of the first season and where it felt off. It‚Äôs not as busy with story telling like the first season but it was still a good watch.
What is a twisted mermaid???<br>The lady hooker got me curious!!!<br>Tell me?!!!!
Season 2 is completely off the mark. Its not the Witcher at all anymore. The show lost all character it could have had. Its so naive and mainstream and so completely not Sapkowski at all. <br>No character talks or acts like they should.
Just watched Season 2. It was so fun! It had me going through my entire range of emotions.
Is season 2 woke trash?
What a piece of crap. Season 1 was bleh, but it was somehow forgivable. This season is just a bland tasteless cliched soap opera with teenage drama level of acting, meaningful gazes and boring af.
Netflix sent me 8 episodes ü§©ü§©ü§©
Just watched the first 2 episodes. The cinematography is beautiful, the CGI first rate and the story and acting are stellar.
it is so bad. Like so freaking bad xD watched 5 episodes. Will probably watch all as it makes me lought for all the reasons tv show shoulden&#39;t. It is my opinion if you enjoyed great for you :) btw. I might be biased as I read the books multiple times and to bo honest was hoping for a book adaptation and changing the worlds mechanics id too much for me.
I had issues with the first episode but after that, or at least up to episode 4, it gets much better. so far the show is an 8.5/10 for me.
didnt read the books huh ? Anyone who likes the show didnt most of the time, i wish i could like this series, but unfortunately its the most broken adaptation ever, too many freaking dumb changes...
Austin you are making realy a genuine reviews
Cavill and the soundtrack was the only good thing about s1. Lazy writing by Lauren who hasnt written anything in her life. HBO shouldve done this show. Netflix ruins everything even with so much source material present.
Second season feels even cheaper than the first.Its like they think the hype of witcher will cary this show and they dont need to try that hard to make it.Maybe one day we get faithfull adaptation that is just.Not this diversified bullshit.
It&#39;s awfully boring, and they stuffed too many black and brown actors in the show, so the whole Northeastern European feel is gone completely.
The witcher season 2 sucks. Literally shit. Read the books please. This is a friend advice
Austin you&#39;re BA
This needs to be said loud and clear: the series is not an adaptation of the books. It takes some facts from the book and creates its own story. Sometimes even completely contradictory to what is in the book. It is very, very pity, because it brings out a lot of stupidity.
&quot;Is Henry Cavill more buff&quot; his gear stack was released two weeks ago by his sponsors, so yeah. RIP Cavills chicken and broccoli regiment. It&#39;s a substantial stack, so he&#39;s fn sauced to the gills. He&#39;s been roasted the past few weeks on social media. No one cares, but the community hates dishonesty about roids, given  many are attempting to remove the stigma surrounding it. <br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s a decent series of you desire, &quot;The Ciri Show&quot; and not tf Witcher. I&#39;d of really enjoyed bit if I were not educated on the franchise. It was heavily criticized in the first season for placing far too much emphasis on Ciri and Yenn; I was indifferent. This season I share the sentiment, and it&#39;s going to trigger die hard fans of the franchise that desire to witness the hunt. It&#39;s the fundamental basis of the lore, and should be the premise of the series. I didn&#39;t wait two years for one fn monster kill.... It&#39;s 5am, on episode 6 and it&#39;s a strong meh. I suspect this review will not age well with a large portion of the community; the majority. Men want to see a video game character that hunts monsters kill sh!t. Not view him play surrogate papa to an incredibly unlikeable, presumedly overpowered prodigy child predestined to save humanity with some untapped ability, that will be used for global destruction if not harnessed correctly. The entirety of humanity is tired of the archetype.<br><br>This is predicted on the presumption that the rest of the series continues at this uneventful, melodramatic pace.
Austin!! I&#39;ll be watching
Dude you‚Äôve got over 100k subscribers! Edit out the mistake <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuSMAj0lGis&amp;t=8m02s"">8:02</a>
Spoiler review please :)
Your background is so symmetrical I love it lol
I can‚Äôt wait to hear your spoil talk. I hope the last two episodes make Season 2 even better.
no review tells if season 2 is more  faithful to the book than season one (it doesn t seem according to trailers and extract.<br>Iguess I have to wait tomorrow to know it.
Bad editing... Vereena touches Ciri&#39;s tears with poining finger than licks middle finger... for example
Super review ü§çüëçüèª
Just saw S2 Ep1 and is good!
So happy to hear this season is great, can&#39;t wait. Huge The Witcher fan.
I still have the dislike üëé option
Thanks for the review merry Christmas and can not wait to watch Witcher season 2 this Friday üéÑüíØ
Ok two questions please answer them if you can please. Does the music have more Slavic feel and the show as well? Like in the games? Like this? <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQS4o_bYA_M"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQS4o_bYA_M</a><br>And most important how do they handle Ciri&#39;s character and the Elder Blood. Do they explain it well? Do they showcase that Ciri is the most dangerous, powerful and destructive force in the whole Witcher universe? Please tell me if you can please? These things are way important for many fans of the Witcher. Also they didn&#39;t handle Vesemir&#39;s character well if your saying is anything to go about and he is an important character..Like this scene alone shows how important both Vesemir and Elves are. In fact they are some of the focus points of the whole universe. <br><a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=grL5mqnKcD4"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=grL5mqnKcD4</a>
I am excited for  season 2 üòä

Austin, serious question, is there any combat sections like the first episode of season 1 had so far in this new season of the Witcher, I&#39;m curious is all? ü§îüôÇ
Can you make Kaitou Joker review?
spoil it baby
Austin are you a gamer?
Hey Austin just curious when you are doing reviews on either TV shows or movies what category do you classify your review videos under when you are about to upload your review? Entertainment or Film &amp; Animation?
So hyped.<br>This is one of the only good things on Streaming right now.
It&#39;s interesting that your criticism of season 2 is that it sometimes focuses on secondary characters that are not as interesting as the main characters as that was one of the problems I had with the books.
Gotta admit I skipped to the end because I don&#39;t want to know anything but if it&#39;s good or bad. I&#39;m really excited now, thank you! But I will come back and compare notes once I have watched it in three days. Also thank you so much for all your reviews this year, I hope you&#39;ll have comfy end of the year. Much love.
After your review, I&#39;m more excited to watch season 2
Nah. I&#39;m skipping this out of spite for Netflix giving out review copies ahead of release.
Wow, 90%! Hmmm, I was looking forward to the new season before your review. Now I&#39;m <b>really stoked</b> for the new season! Thanks!üëçüèª
I see critics give this 75/100 on Metacritic, but I bet the user score will be much higher based on what you‚Äôre saying. Very excited for this one!
We want spoiler review!!
Based on the game and show, it seems like they are making Criel the new Witcher who will take Grealt&#39;s place.
Alright now were cooking with fire Austin! As for Cavil everyone can‚Äôt help but like him. Dude is just that cool
I just started season 1 and am loving it so far. So pleased to hear season 2 is better
